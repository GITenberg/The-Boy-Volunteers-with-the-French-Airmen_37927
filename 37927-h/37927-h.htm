WITH THE FRENCH<br />
AIRMEN</h1>

<h2><br />CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2>ANTWERP AND THE FLIGHT THROUGH NORTHERN BELGIUM</h2>

<p><br />Antwerp was in a fever of excitement, as Ralph
and Alfred marched up from the quay with the
Belgian troops, and rumors of an immediate attack
on the city were flying about.</p>

<p>"Look at the Zeppelin!" cried out a voice.</p>

<p>The boys turned to follow the gaze of the people
who lined the streets. There, almost directly
west, they caught the first glimpse of one of the
monsters which appeared to be moving south, far
beyond the reach of the encircling forts, but
plainly visible.</p>

<p>"Nothing would suit me better than a trip in
a flying machine!" exclaimed Alfred.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be fine?" replied Ralph.</p>

<p>The sight seemed to be an inspiration to the
boys. Our story will tell how the idea so impressed
itself on their minds that they almost felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
it a duty to join a flying corps. That, however,
seemed to be an impossibility.</p>

<p>They had passed through Belgium, participated
in the first battles of the war, had been captured,
and escaped from the Germans, and had now
reached Antwerp, with the retreating Belgian
army, where Ralph had hoped to meet his father,
whom they had left in Germany almost four weeks
prior to that time.</p>

<p>As the father had not arrived, owing to the embargo
which had been placed on all travelers from
Germany to the warring countries, the boys found
themselves stranded in a strange city. Fortunately,
their connection with the army, and the
fact that they had rendered Belgium some service,
made it possible for them to get food and lodging.</p>

<p>"We have forgotten one thing," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why, we never went to the Post Office," replied
Ralph.</p>

<p>At the General Post Office they received a letter
from Alfred's father, only to learn that he
had been detained, as was the case with thousands
of Americans, and that it would be impossible for
him to reach Antwerp. Instead, he would be permitted
to go through Switzerland, and from that
country reach Paris where he hoped to meet them.</p>

<p>"But we have no money now, what shall we
do?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's what worries me," answered Ralph.
"Father supposes that Pierre is still with us, and
that we are supplied with money."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Three days after receiving the letter the boys
heard the first definite news of the great movement
of German troops designed to attack the forts. If
they surrounded the city, and besieged it, the
chances of reaching Paris would be small, indeed.</p>

<p>"Something must be done, and that today,"
said Ralph. "I am going to leave if I have to
walk."</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>Ralph smiled, as he said: "We might walk to
Holland."</p>

<p>Alfred almost shouted for joy, as he exclaimed:
"That's a good idea. We have about ten francs
left; that ought to take us through."</p>

<p>A map was consulted. "Why, yes," said Alfred,
"we can go north to Eeckeren, and from that
place to Capellen, close to the frontier. It's only
twelve miles."</p>

<p>After this decision they again visited the Post
Office, and immediately crossed through the city
with a view of striking the main highway leading
to Holland. Reaching the outskirts of the city,
they were surprised to see great masses of Belgian
troops encamped close to the forts, which guarded
the highway. They soon learned that a strong
German column had reached Brasscheat, three
miles from Eeckeren.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in amazement.
"Well, this beats everything," said Alfred, with a
shade of bitterness. "The Germans seem to be
in our way whichever direction we turn. We'll
have to take another route."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another route?" blurted out Ralph. "There
isn't another way to go on this side of the river.
It would be a long tramp to cross the river."</p>

<p>They were now in a serious dilemma, and stood
there undecided as to the best course to follow,
when they were startled by a voice: "Hello,
boys!"</p>

<p>"It's Pierre!" shouted Alfred, who was the first
to spy their friend.</p>

<p>"And how did you get here?" asked Alfred.
"We thought they had captured you at Rouen."</p>

<p>"So they did, but we got away the same night.
But where are you going?" returned Pierre.</p>

<p>"Trying to get to Holland," he was informed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will have to go south of the
Scheldt to get there," Pierre then informed
them.</p>

<p>"But I received a letter from father, and he
wants us to meet him in Paris," said Alfred.
"You know we don't want to be shut up in the city,
if the Germans are going to surround it."</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered Pierre. "But in the
meantime we must find some other way out. You
know you are still in the army, in the messenger
service, and come to think of it, you haven't received
any pay so far, have you?"</p>

<p>The boys laughed, for that part of it had been
entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; the Germans paid us for work at
the hospital," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"And you repaid them by skipping out the next
day," said Pierre with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much do you think there is due us now?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are on the rolls for, but
there must be a full month's pay due, and that
would be about thirty-five francs apiece," said
Pierre.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five francs!" mused Ralph. "Twice
thirty-five is seventy,&mdash;about fourteen dollars.
Good, that will take us through."</p>

<p>"I suggest that you come to headquarters and
join us. We intend to cross the river. It will be
the safest place for you," said Pierre.</p>

<p>"That will suit me," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Together they marched to headquarters where
they were again installed and placed on the rolls.
Late that night the regiment began its march,
reaching the dock below Antwerp at ten o'clock,
where they had a long wait before the crowded
boats left the pier. On landing, the march was
resumed, and did not halt for two hours, so it was
nearly three in the morning before they were able
to lie down for the much needed sleep.</p>

<p>It did not seem that they had slept a half hour
when they were awakened by the heavy booming
notes of cannon, and the occasional rattle and
crash of small guns. The boys now knew the kind
of music which the different weapons ground out.</p>

<p>"That's a machine gun, see how regularly the
shots come," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that's a salvo from infantry," replied
Ralph. "The Mannlicher guns have an awfully
snappy way of talking. Do you hear it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
There it is again. They must be rushing some of
the outer works."</p>

<p>The real fight, however, was between the forts
and the heavy German guns, which continued during
the entire day, principally on the southern and
eastern sides of the city. The struggle was continuous
for four days. Suddenly Pierre burst in
with the startling information:</p>

<p>"The Germans have silenced two of the forts,
and Antwerp is doomed."</p>

<p>No time was lost by the defending troops, and
before noon the camp was dismantled, and the
march begun.</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are going!" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than that we are going to leave
Antwerp, and try to reach the sea," replied
Pierre.</p>

<p>The Belgian army had begun its famous march
across the northern end of Belgium in order to
reach the sea, and secure the protection of the
English fleet in the Channel.</p>

<p>"I heard some one say that we intended going
through Bruges," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; and from there the army may be able to
reach France, after passing through Ostend," said
Pierre.</p>

<p>In an air line Bruges is fifty miles from Antwerp,
and from Bruges to the French frontier it
is fully forty miles more. How the brave little
army finally reached its destination, avoiding the
large German forces sent out to intercept them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
remains one of the most glorious exploits in the
history of the Belgian army.</p>

<p>"Next to Belgium I am glad to be in France,"
said Pierre. "Now you can get to Paris without
difficulty," he added.</p>

<p>It thus happened that six weeks after the boys
entered Belgium southwest of Liege, they reached
Dunkirk on the French coast, and saw the immense
fleet of warships and transports, which the British
had in the harbor. It seemed that every spot
around the city was taken up by tents, wagons,
mules, horses, and heavy guns, to say nothing of
the soldiers on every hand.</p>

<p>One regiment after the other entrained in cars,
and were whirled to the south. Box cars, flat cars,
some new, others dilapidated, were in service. It
seemed that there were thousands of automobiles
in line, and every one was anxious to get away.
They even saw thousands of men, with full kits
on their backs, march out to the east, as though
they scorned to wait for railway or auto accommodations.</p>

<p>Pierre was at the door of the boys' tent early in
the morning of the second day. "I am glad to
tell you that the roll has been signed, and you can
get your pay," he said. "But I am awfully sorry
to have you go."</p>

<p>"Of course, we've had some pretty hard times,"
said Ralph, "but it was a great experience.
Maybe we'll come back again."</p>

<p>"We're going to try to join the flying
machines," said Alfred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierre laughed, and Ralph smiled, for, while
that idea was uppermost in his mind, he had never
discussed the subject with Alfred sufficiently to
enable them to call it a plan that they really intended
to follow out. It was more an enthusiastic
feeling of something that they would like to do,
without knowing just how they would go about it.</p>

<p>"So you are really going to start for Paris this
afternoon?" said Pierre.</p>

<p>"Yes; we ought to be there now, for father will
wonder what is the matter with us. You see he
hasn't heard from us for six weeks, and it has been
two weeks since we received his letter," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you wire the Continental
Hotel, Paris, and tell him you are on the way?
It will relieve his anxiety. Tell him to answer you
at once, for it may take you several days to reach
Paris," said Pierre.</p>

<p>"Several days?" queried Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Troops occupy all the cars now,"
replied Pierre.</p>

<p>So the telegram was sent, and it was decided to
remain where they were until morning so as to
receive the reply before starting. But no answer
came that night or the next day. In the meantime,
the boys wandered from place to place, for, as they
still wore the trim Belgian suits, they were privileged
to visit many places barred from civilians.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they found themselves far
down the road leading to Ypres, when they were
startled at the sound of an unusual buzzing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
soon divined the cause as they saw a dozen or more
airplanes flying around over the broad fields to
the east. Nothing more was needed to give the
boys an inspiration. They moved toward the
great field, as though a giant magnet pulled them.
Long before they were near the hangars they could
see the flyers far above them, circling about. The
scene fascinated them.</p>

<p>Then something like a dull explosion startled
them, and they looked at each other and then
glanced about.</p>

<p>"There it is; look at it; directly above us,"
shouted Alfred, in great excitement.</p>

<p>"Something has happened; it's on fire," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short space of time, something
struck and rattled along the ground not far
from them, but the machine, although falling, was
still some hundreds of feet from the earth. One
of the operators could be seen frantically drawing
back the levers, and trying to hold the badly
damaged ship from overturning, but his efforts
were unavailing.</p>

<p>The boys closed their eyes as the swiftly moving
machine now actually rolled down through space,
tumbling over and over, until it finally struck the
ground with a crashing noise, not a hundred feet
from where they stood. Terrorized at the sight,
they stood still for a few moments, but this was
no worse than the scenes they had witnessed in
battle, so, without a word, they made a rush for
the mound of debris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are both under the machine," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Look at the smoke; it's afire," shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>"Use sand! use sand!" almost shrieked Alfred.</p>

<p>They had early learned that sand is more effectual
as a fire extinguisher of burning oil than
water, if properly applied. Handsful of sand
were scooped up and applied. A groan from one
of the men arrested their movements.</p>

<p>Alfred jumped on the broken mass, and peered
down. "There he is!" he shouted. Ralph
crawled over the broken body of the airplane, and
reached down.</p>

<p>"No; this man is lying still," he said. "Here
he is; come on this side; he is under the framework."</p>

<p>The scene was one which well might inspire
heroic work.</p>

<p>The imprisoned man was quite young, with
handsome features, and it seemed cruel that such
a fate should overtake him. The boys strained at
the wreck until it moved.</p>

<p>"Brace it up on that side," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The truss from the fuselage was removed from
the aviator, the man quickly drawn out from his
perilous position, and carried clear of the wreck.</p>

<p>"Now for the other one," said Alfred.</p>

<p>Blood was still flowing across the face of the
other flyer, as they crawled over the wreck to
draw him out.</p>

<p>"This one is alive, I am sure," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; his heart is beating," replied Alfred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as the injured men were laid side by side.</p>

<p>"I have heard that they have first aid packages
in machines of this kind," said Ralph, as he
sprang toward the remains of the machine. "I
have it," he cried, as he leaped over the wrecked
pieces. "Here is&mdash;a&mdash;<i>Restorative</i>, whatever that
is,&mdash;half a wineglass at a time,&mdash;where's the wineglass?"</p>

<p>"Give each a good swallow of it," said Alfred,
as he raised up the head of the one first rescued.</p>

<p>The other man opened his eyes. "Lieutenant!"
he said. Then, as he gazed at the boys, he seemed
to smile, and as Alfred held up the bottle he feebly
nodded.</p>

<p>It seemed to revive him in a few moments, and
he struggled to raise himself. "I feel better now,
but something hurts my legs," he said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant opened his eyes, and quietly
looked at the boys without speaking.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Is Jack hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but he is all right," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Here I am; still on top," said Jack, as he
slightly turned, and moved his hand toward the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"And what are you boys doing here?" asked
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"On our way to Paris," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"But where did you get the uniforms?" asked
the officer.</p>

<p>"Why, we've been in the Belgian army, and
were in several fights," said Ralph proudly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant's face brightened into a smile,
which quickly changed to one of pain. An ambulance
stopped alongside with startling suddenness,
for the boys had been too busy to notice that
the watchers at the hangars had signaled for assistance.
The men were carefully carried to the
van, and as they were about to start the lieutenant
motioned to the doctor in charge, and said:</p>

<p>"I want the boys to come along with us."</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2>IN THE AVIATION CAMP</h2>

<p><br />Once inside the ambulance the boys had an opportunity
to watch the doctors, as they removed
the clothing from the men, and began a search for
the location and nature of the injuries. It was a
gratification to be able to assist in this work.
Jack's legs were both broken, and the lieutenant's
chest, back and right arm were bruised and clotted
with blood.</p>

<p>"I think they are all right," said the doctor in
charge.</p>

<p>"But it's awfully hard breathing," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"You must have had a pretty good weight on
top of you," remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Ralph. "It was all
we could do to lift up the cross piece of the frame
from him."</p>

<p>"We'll straighten you out in a few days," answered
the doctor, "but your companion didn't
fare as well. Compound fracture of one leg; but
he has a good constitution; he's good for several
trips yet."</p>

<p>The gratitude of the lieutenant was plainly observable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and the doctor was quick to notice it.
"If these young men hadn't taken you out when
they did it would have been all over with you, because
the weight prevented you from breathing."</p>

<p>The lieutenant tried to smile, as he gazed at the
boys, and they understood.</p>

<p>When the ambulance reached the hospital there
were fifty or more aviators from the station,
awaiting the news. The boys leaped out, the attendants
were on hand with the stretchers, while
the excited men crowded around the boys to learn
the details. It was not long before the story of
the rescue was known. The chief of the flying
squadron came out of the hospital, and approached
the boys. The latter straightened up
and saluted.</p>

<p>"You should be commended for the prompt
work you performed in rescuing the lieutenant
and his pilot. I understand you belong to the Belgian
army; but you are not Belgians, are you?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, we are not," said Alfred, slightly embarrassed
at the question.</p>

<p>The Commandant smiled as he continued: "I
take it that you are Americans?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain; you are right," replied Ralph.
"We joined the Belgian army at Liege, and fought
the enemy all the way to Antwerp, and we had
some pretty hot times, too."</p>

<p>This speech was applauded heartily, while a
young man sprang forward, held out his hand and
said: "And here's United States, too."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are not with the army now," said Alfred,
recovering; "we hope to go to Paris, if it is possible
to get there."</p>

<p>"The chances for that are not very good at
present," observed the Commandant, "but in the
meantime, if you are not attached, you must put
up with us."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the offer," said Ralph eagerly.
"We want to get into the flying service; that will
just suit us."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that the army provisions would
not permit you to join," said the officer, and all
noted the expressions of disappointment that indicated
the boys' feelings at this announcement.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we'll have to force our way in,
just as we did in Belgium," said Alfred.</p>

<p>This was greeted with a sally of laughter. The
boys had made a hit with the corps, and they accepted
the offer of quarters for their accommodation
in the firm belief that something would turn
up to assist them in their desires.</p>

<p>Boys are really at a disadvantage sometimes.
This story, as well as many others, shows that
they are capable of doing things as well as men,
and that they can do some things better than
most men; but in military matters the service
seems to have been made for grown-up people on
the principle that war is too barbarous a thing
for young men until they are twenty years of age.</p>

<p>The boys, who were now in their glory, had a
portion of a small room in a wooden building assigned
to them. At this time there were fifty machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of various types on the ground, the particular
makes being the Bristol, the B. E., several
Farman machines, and a half dozen Sopworth
tractors.</p>

<p>Tom Walton, the young American who greeted
them at the hospital, was accorded the privilege of
escorting the boys and introducing them. That
they had been in the first battles of the war was
sufficient to give them a coveted place in that company
of enthusiastic men, for there was some
glory in having been on a battlefield,&mdash;a thing
which could have been said of only a few of those
who entertained them that day.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to see the machines," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"Indeed, we do," said Alfred. "What is that
big machine over there?"</p>

<p>"That is a Bristol," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"And there is another one," remarked Ralph,
pointing to a machine, which was being drawn out
of the hangar.</p>

<p>"No, that's a B. E. biplane," answered Tom.
"You will see the difference by observing the
shape of the planes. The Bristol has the ends of
the wings rounded so that the forward corners are
cut away to a greater extent than the rear corners.
In the B. E. the wings are cut to conform with the
well-known Wright type."</p>

<p>"That's a Farman machine, I know," said
Ralph, pointing to an aeroplane which had a huge
revolving type of motor forward of the main
planes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but when that machine is high in the air
it would be difficult to recognize it from that description,"
said Tom. "You will notice that the
lower plane is much shorter than the upper plane,
and that it has a great spreading tail,&mdash;larger
than any other machine now made."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">

</div>

<p>"Here is another kind, a little fellow. That
certainly looks different from all the others," said
Alfred, as they stopped in front of a hangar.</p>

<p>"That's the Sopworth tractor, a fine, speedy
machine, with square ends to the planes, and a
heart-shaped tail. It can be distinguished at any
altitude," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"I notice that that has different tails," said
Ralph. "Does that make any difference in the
flying?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. Shape has nothing to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
it. Surface is all that counts. They are made
with distinctive forms so that they may be easily
distinguished, one from the other."</p>

<p>"We saw some German airplanes, several dozens
of them, in Belgium, and the only one I could
recognize was the Taube, as they called it. They
have fan-shaped tails," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"But here is the machine for business," said
Tom, as they halted in front of a gaily decorated
hangar, and pointed to a trim little machine, which
was being overhauled.</p>

<p>"I see you have the Stars and Stripes above the
door," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; and this is my machine; isn't it a
beauty?" said Tom with a considerable show of
pride.</p>

<p>"What is it? I mean what make?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"It is a French Morane; I have made many
trips in it," said Tom, "and now I am going to
use it against the Dutchies."</p>

<p>Thus they were conducted from place to place,
visited the machine shop, which had been set up
for repairs, and then inspected the landing field,
which was designed to be illuminated for night
work.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you use the flying machines
at night?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; that is going to be a great
stunt," said Tom. "The only trouble is that
where there are many lights about it is pretty hard
for a pilot to hunt out the landing place, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
authorities have made special provision for returning
aviators to enable them to land with as
much safety as in the daytime."</p>

<p>"How is it arranged so they can land without
a mistake?" asked Alfred.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="536" height="400" alt="Airplanes of the Central Powers" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Do you see that tall pylon, over there?" replied
Tom. "That has on it the pilot light, much
more brilliant than anything in sight. Now, look
over to the left, nearly a quarter of a mile away;
that pylon carries a brilliant red light. The other
two pylons to the north and to the south have blue
lights. The aviator knows that the bright light is
to the east of the red light, and that he must make
a landing somewhere between the brilliant light
and the red light, between the limits marked by
the blue lights."</p>

<p>"I should think that would be easy," said
Ralph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is when the night is clear; but the trouble
is that the fog from the channel gives us considerable
trouble, and then we have to glide back and
forth very low to get our bearings, and that is
dangerous business in the night."</p>

<p>The inspection raised the enthusiasm of the boys
to the highest pitch. For them there was now no
other life than flying, and, indeed, things seemed
to be coming their way. They had learned more
about machines during the two hours thus spent
than they had acquired in all their lives previous
to that time.</p>

<p>"I want to ask a favor of you," said Alfred,
as they were returning to their quarters.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I would like to go up in a machine with you,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>Tom stopped, and looked at Alfred. "Do you
really mean it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's what I want to do, too," chimed in
Ralph.</p>

<p>"It's against the rules to take up any one but
the observers during practice hours; but let me
see,&mdash;we may be able to fix it up some other time,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"Do you have to do much practicing?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Only from six to eight hours a day," answered
Tom.</p>

<p>"What! do you mean practice flying when you
are not scouting?" asked Ralph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I should say so," was the answer.</p>

<p>"How long have you been flying?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"About two years," said Tom.</p>

<p>"And still they make you fly every day, for
practice?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Tom.</p>

<p>"And what is that for?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Flying airplanes for war purposes is something
different to ordinary flying. The principal
practice is to learn the methods of attack and defense.
But that is not all. The airplane is the
eye of the army; the observer must know how to
observe. He must be able not only to see, but to
put his knowledge into such form that it can be
handed in in the form of a report. While he may
get the information he must learn that the information
is not for his own gratification, but for the
use of the men in the field," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Do all the machines carry a pilot and an observer?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Not by any means," answered Tom. "The
first duty of a pilot is to learn how to control his
machine when approaching an enemy, and how to
attack or to avoid him. For that purpose he has
a machine gun which he uses in flying."</p>

<p>"I had no idea that there was so much to do in
the business," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is only part of the practice," continued
Tom. "The most interesting part of the work is
to practice flying in squadron formation, to observe
the signals of the commanding officer and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
execute movements. For this purpose two squadrons
oppose each other, and sally forth, the object
being to judge the objects of an attacking
force and to devise means to repel the enemy."</p>

<p>The boys sat on their improvised bunks until a
late hour that night. They discussed the airplanes;
the men they had met; their work in rescuing
the fallen aviators, and the things they had
learned in this, to them, the most eventful day.</p>

<p>"I wonder what father would say if he knew we
were going to join the aviation corps?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder what he will say when he hears
what we were doing in Belgium," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"He must have gotten our letters by this time,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't he answer our telegram?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why, we forgot to go back to the city and inquire
for it," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's so; but we've been too busy for that;
we must do that the first thing in the morning,"
said Alfred.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2>THE WOUNDED AVIATORS</h2>

<p><br />They were out early the next morning, and
started for the tramway a mile distant. They
passed Tom's hangar, and stopped for a moment
to take a look at his machine. As they were leaving
they heard his voice:</p>

<p>"Going to leave us?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No; but we must go to the city to get our
mail, and we are expecting a telegram," shouted
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Get back by eleven o'clock if you can," was
the answer.</p>

<p>"We'll be here, sure," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"He must mean that we can have a try in the
machine at that time, I suppose," remarked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"I imagine that's why he wants us back then,"
answered Alfred.</p>

<p>They covered the mile in record time. The idea
of going up in a machine was a stimulus, and they
talked about it all the way, and wondered what it
would feel like to sail above the earth in a war-machine.</p>

<p>At the post office they had their first disappointment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and there was nothing at the telegraph office.
They were perplexed at the absence of news,
but consoled themselves with the thought that
transportation from the Swiss frontier might be
in the same condition as at the Western front, so
they decided they would not remain long in the
city.</p>

<p>The city, containing a population of about
40,000, is located on the sand dunes. It takes its
name from the old church of St. Eloi, and means
<i>church on the dunes</i>. It has been in existence for
over a thousand years, and was owned by the
Dutch, the Spaniards, and the English, before it
became permanent French territory.</p>

<p>Passing through the principal square, on their
way to the terminus of the tram cars, they saw
crowds of people moving toward the main landing
place of vessels. They followed, and witnessed
the debarkation of the first vessel load of
Red Cross supplies, accompanied by a large corps
of physicians and Red Cross nurses.</p>

<p>Fully fifty vans were taken from the ship and
lined up, with their equipments, ready for a
prompt start. A number of lorries (large motor
trucks), carrying beds, bedding and like material,
followed, and were placed behind the vans.</p>

<p>"Do you know where they are going?" asked
Ralph, addressing a young man in uniform.</p>

<p>"To the general hospital, where they will be assigned
to stations near the front," he replied.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the general hospital near the
aviation ground?" inquired Alfred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Probably we can get a chance to ride there,"
said Ralph, addressing Alfred.</p>

<p>The man overheard the remark, and quickly
turned to the boys.</p>

<p>"Are you attached to the flying squadron?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then they wouldn't object, I am sure,"
answered the officer, and he strode forward.
After speaking a few words to one who seemed to
be in charge, he motioned to them.</p>

<p>"Get in, boys," he said.</p>

<p>They were quick to respond, and, after thanking
the officer, mounted one of the vans. Inside
were three nurses and two physicians, who smiled
at the boys.</p>

<p>"So you are going to war, too?" said one of
the nurses, as she made room for them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alfred, rather shyly; "we are
going back."</p>

<p>"Going back?" remarked one of the doctors.
"Did you say 'going back?'" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, we were with the Belgian army from
Liege to Antwerp, and came across the northern
part of Belgium with them," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then you must have seen some fighting?"
asked one of the others, much interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; we were in the first battles of the
war," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The information was certainly an interesting
bit of news. From that time on the boys were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
center of interest, and many questions were plied
and answered.</p>

<p>"But where are you bound now?" asked one of
the doctors. "If I understand correctly, you are
attached to the aviation corps, is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are being put up by them, and we may
do some flying in a few days," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"We do hope you will be successful," said one
of the nurses. "Won't you tell us where you are
from?"</p>

<p>"We are from New York," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then you are not English?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Alfred. "But that doesn't
make any difference. It's just the same as though
we were English. We want to help out."</p>

<p>There was a merry roar of laughter at this, and
Ralph immediately chimed in with a sort of explanation:
"The Germans didn't treat us right,
when they captured us, and, anyhow, they had no
business to attack Belgium."</p>

<p>"Good for you," said a sweet little miss. "We
like Americans, and especially those like you who
have that spirit."</p>

<p>The vans covered the ground to the general hospital
in quick time, and the boys were really sorry
when the van drew up before the building, but
they quickly recognized the place where they had
accompanied the injured aviators the previous
day.</p>

<p>"Ralph, we ought to go in and see the lieutenant
and Jack," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" interposed the doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, they fell with their machine yesterday,
and we helped them out," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"What was the lieutenant's name?" asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Why, we don't know; we forgot to ask for it;
but maybe they will let us in," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Come along," said the doctor. "We'll find a
way to get in."</p>

<p>They followed him up the steps, and marched to
the office, where the doctor was greeted by many
of those present.</p>

<p>"Who was it that met with an accident yesterday?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Winston," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And was he badly hurt?" almost shrieked the
sweet little nurse who had accompanied the party
in the van.</p>

<p>"No; he is getting along well," said the attending
physician. "He owes his life to a couple of
brave lads, who happened to be near. He has been
anxious to see the boys, and has asked where they
were."</p>

<p>"We are the ones who helped him," said Ralph.
"We want to see him; may we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you so much," said the
nurse.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>"He is my brother; may we go to him at once?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I will take you to him," said the physician.</p>

<p>"So you are Miss Winston?" said Alfred.
"Isn't it funny how we happened to meet you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>She almost hugged the boys in her joy at the
news, and at her good fortune in thus meeting the
boys who were instrumental in saving her
brother.</p>

<p>The lieutenant saw his sister approaching arm
in arm with the two boys. The greeting was a
most affectionate one.</p>

<p>"I met the two boys in Dunkirk; they just happened
to get into our van. We learned after we
got here what they had done. Isn't it noble of
them?" she said.</p>

<p>"I have tried to find them all day," said the
lieutenant, and he pressed the hands of the boys.
"Yes, I was in an awfully tight place when the
boys found me; but I am all right now."</p>

<p>They remained with the lieutenant and his sister
for more than an hour. They had entirely forgotten
their appointment with Tom. It was nearly
twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall have to leave you," said
Ralph. "We promised Tom to be over at the
hangar at eleven."</p>

<p>"Tom Brandon; the American dare-devil?"
said the lieutenant, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied Alfred, somewhat hesitatingly.
"Is he a dare-devil?" he continued, with
wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, he doesn't seem to be afraid of anything;
I suppose he would go anywhere, if he was
ordered to make the trip. Is your engagement an
important one?" asked the lieutenant, with a curious
light in his eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;yes,&mdash;we&mdash;we wanted to take a flight
this afternoon," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Do you think they would let us?" asked Alfred
quickly.</p>

<p>"Rather against the rules and somewhat risky,"
said the lieutenant, slowly shaking his head, but
his face relaxed, as he saw the crestfallen appearance
of the boys. "We can get around the rules
sometimes," he added.</p>

<p>"Tom said he would try to fix it for us," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Then go at once, and tell him that Winston
gave him permission," said the lieutenant. "Do
you think it is safe, Addie?" he asked, turning to
his sister.</p>

<p>"It seems to me it is safe to trust boys who
have been in battles as they have, don't you?"
she replied sweetly, as she arose and grasped the
boys' hands. "Now, don't forget us, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; we intend to come over to see you
in the morning," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The boys fairly flew across the broad grounds
in order to reach the hangar. Their chagrin was
great as they peered in to find that Tom and his
machine were absent.</p>

<p>"Looking for Tom?" asked one of the men.</p>

<p>"Yes; do you know where he is?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"He's coming now, I think," was the reply, as
the man approached the door and glanced upward.
"Yes; there he is, winging it in."</p>

<p>Within two minutes the Morane gave a quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
dive, then flattened out and skimmed the ground,
and just before alighting the nose of the machine
gave a short, quick, upward dart.</p>

<p>"He does that the slickest of the whole lot.
That was a quick stop, sure enough," remarked
an attendant.</p>

<p>The machine had landed not two hundred feet
from the hangar. The boys were over without
delay, and accosted Tom, as he reached the
ground.</p>

<p>"We are sorry that we couldn't get here in
time, but we met Lieutenant Winston's sister coming
over, and we were detained at the hospital,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"It's just as well, as I couldn't make it. The
commandant wouldn't give me the time to take
you out," said Tom.</p>

<p>"But the lieutenant told us to tell you that he
gave you permission to take us," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Did he say that? Well, that's another thing.
I'll tell the commandant," and, without another
word, he crossed the field, and disappeared. He
was back in five minutes, and waved his hat as he
appeared.</p>

<p>"All right, boys; we'll have an hour's flight;
how will that suit you?" he said.</p>

<p>The boys were too much excited to know what
to say in reply. Tom walked around the machine,
observing every part of the control plane and the
wires, then mounted the chassis, and with a wrench
unscrewed the base of the machine gun.</p>

<p>"Here, boys; we'll take this off for the afternoon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
it'll give you more room. There, take hold
of it at both ends, and carry it into the hangar,"
he said, as he handed down the weapon.</p>

<p>"Gee! but that weighs something!" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Close to eighty pounds, I should say," observed
Tom.</p>

<p>"Where shall we sit?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"You can easily crowd into the hole in front,"
said Tom. "Now don't get frightened and jump
out; I can bring you down easier than that. If
it seems to turn over, don't mind. That's part
of the game."</p>

<p>The Morane was equipped with a self-starter,
but three attendants were on hand to hold the machine.
They took their places and Tom turned
on the switch. Whir-r-r-r-r,&mdash;they felt the tremor
of the machine. Soon Tom's hand was raised and
came down with a swift motion. They felt the
machine slowly gain headway, and then it seemed
to spring forward with huge leaps. At first they
could feel the oscillating motion of the wheels,
and as the speed increased there was less jar until
finally there was no further vertical movement,
and they no longer felt the wheels traveling over
the ground.</p>

<p>"We're up!" shouted Ralph in excitement, as
he turned to Tom. The latter evidently knew what
Ralph meant, even though the noise of the motor
prevented him from hearing, for he merely smiled,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>Alfred leaned over the side of the body, and
gazed at the wheels, and as he did so something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
seemed to push the seat of the aeroplane upwardly.
He quickly turned toward Tom and
smiled. They were in the air. How glorious it
seemed to Ralph and Alfred at that moment. The
feeling was an indescribable one; they were now
going up rapidly; ahead was a tall pylon, which
seemed to be directly in their way.</p>

<p>Ralph seized Alfred's arm, and pointed toward
it, their eyes being intently fixed on the square
flag which flew above the mast, but the machine
seemed to whiz by it like a streak. After passing
it the machine seemed to slow down. They were
not aware that the closer you are to an object the
faster seems to be the motion. Looking down at
the earth they could note an object for some time,
and as they went further up and up, things on the
earth seemed to pass by with less and less speed.</p>

<p>The most confusing thing to them was the constant
change of position. Instead of making a
straight-away flight Tom circled around the aviation
field twice, going higher on each turn. The
great hangar was plainly visible each time they
came around, but it grew smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>The boys leaned over the body of the machine,
and scanned the earth below. It was too grand
and inspiring for words. It was some time before
they began to realize that the hangars were
disappearing, and that the machine was now going
forward in one direction. The country below was
a confused maze of narrow yellow streaks, bordered
by green and yellow spots, with innumerable
rows of dark green and brown bands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
patches, which they soon recognized as trees, while
cottages and larger buildings dotted the whole
landscape as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Alfred was the first to cast his eyes to the
north. What he saw almost startled him. A dark
vivid green spread to the horizon, blending with
a pale mist, far, far away.</p>

<p>"Look! look!" he cried.</p>

<p>"That's the sea!" shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>Tom smiled as he reveled in their joy. He
pointed ahead, and the boys quickly turned. Far
off, in the distance, they saw what seemed to be
immense fields of snow.</p>

<p>"What can that be?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>Alfred shook his head, and gazed silently, then
turned toward Tom. "Can you make it out?" he
asked Ralph. The latter shook his head.</p>

<p>The machine went on for ten minutes more. Beyond
the white fields something else arrested their
attention; great clouds of smoke were observed.
They were not clouds, and there was no fire visible
on the earth. That was the second mystery.</p>

<p>"I know what that is now," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Tents, tents," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that smoke must come from the big
guns," said Alfred.</p>

<p>Ralph turned his head toward Tom, and raised
his cap. The latter knew that the boys recognized
the nature of the scene before them.</p>

<p>"That must be a battle," said Alfred, as he
pointed to the great clouds of smoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look way over to the left," shouted Ralph.
"See that long, narrow road? There is something
moving there."</p>

<p>"Why, that is cavalry; sure enough. See, they
are turning a corner in the road. That's plain
enough," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he is going to take us over the
German lines?" queried Ralph.</p>

<p>"And suppose something happens, and we are
compelled to go down; we'll be in a nice fix," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head, and glanced back toward
Tom. The latter, however, soon turned the machine.
As he did so a dozen or more aeroplanes
came into view. They noticed that the machine
was going toward a field where a huge gas bag was
moored near the ground. It was an observation
balloon. Beyond were several dozens of flying
machines drawn up in front of the hangars. Tom
circled the machine around several times; the
earth came nearer, and soon they observed a long
stretch of green that seemed to invite them. In
another minute they were several hundred feet
from the earth, and they seemed to go faster and
faster.</p>

<p>"Whew! but doesn't it scoot now," said Alfred.</p>

<p>They grasped the body of the car, while it
seemed to fairly sizzle through the air. Closer
and closer the earth crept up toward them. They
felt that it would be necessary to hold fast when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the shock came. The next sensation was most
peculiar; the body of the car began to rock up
and down; the din of the motor had ceased, and
they were riding on the earth.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2>TRENCH WORK WITH THE BRITISH FORCES</h2>

<p><br />Everyone seemed to know Tom, as he was heartily
greeted on all sides. The appearance of the
boys, however, was a puzzle to the group of aviators.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce my friends, Ralph and Alfred,
genuine American boys, who were with the
Belgians in their great fight from Liege to Antwerp,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"How did that happen?" asked one of the men,
as he grasped their hands.</p>

<p>"We were on the spot when war was declared,
and we just pitched in and helped them out," replied
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Were you in any battles?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Oh, in a dozen, or so," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"Good boys!" shouted several.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to get here?" asked the
first interrogator.</p>

<p>"We came over with the Belgians, from Antwerp,"
said Ralph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing information was enough to introduce
the boys, and they were gratified to find several
other Americans in the party.</p>

<p>The reception was cut short by the peculiar antics
of a huge Farman machine, which was approaching
in an erratic manner. It seemed to dart
back and forth, and swing around in short circles,
as though wounded.</p>

<p>"Something is the matter with Le Clere,"
shouted Tom.</p>

<p>At that moment the machine darted toward the
earth, and the boys held their breaths at the anticipated
calamity. Fifty feet from the earth the
machine righted itself, and swooped upward,
then, with a vicious plunge, it went down and
struck the earth, the crash being plainly heard, although
it landed more than five hundred feet from
where they stood.</p>

<p>Every one on the ground rushed toward the
fallen aviator. Before they reached the scene, two
men extricated themselves, and stood on the debris.</p>

<p>"What was the matter?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Look at the holes in the wings," said Tom.
"That tells the story; pretty well riddled."</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" shouted one of the men.</p>

<p>"Yes, but that was a dandy fight, and we
brought him down," replied Le Clere, a daring
Frenchman, who handled the machine gun.</p>

<p>The Gnome motor was lying on the ground
twenty feet from the wreckage. One of the planes
was tilted up at an angle, and was uninjured, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
it carried the marks of twenty holes, through
which the sunlight streamed.</p>

<p>"That will give you an idea of the fascinating
work we are engaged in," said Tom, pointing to
the bullet marks. The body of the machine was
wrecked, and the fuselage a mass of splinters. It
was, indeed, a mystery how the two flyers escaped
without injury.</p>

<p>"What will they do with the machine?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"They'll build up another out of it in two
days," said Tom.</p>

<p>"The Germans are marching west and south of
Roubaix," said Le Clere. "They have already
reached Mons, and are going straight toward
Paris."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in amazement.
It seemed as though their trip to Paris would be
interrupted, after all. Tom seemed to read their
thoughts.</p>

<p>"How far is it to Mons?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"About fifty miles south," said Tom.</p>

<p>"And what is the name of the town which we
saw before we came down?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Lille," was the response. "But we must be
going back," continued Tom. "We are going to
move south in the morning, and I have a few
things to pack up."</p>

<p>After bidding good-bye to every one, they
climbed into the airplane, and those present gave
the boys a cheer, as the machine glided forward.
Tom had promised to give them an hour's flight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and it was now four o'clock. They had heard
about taking observations, while on the grounds
at Lille, and they busied themselves in trying to
do work of that character. How small the houses
were! They could see little creeping things, that
soon evolved themselves into horses and wagons,
but they seemed unreal.</p>

<p>The flight to Lille covered a distance of forty-five
miles, and it took them an hour. It didn't
seem that they could have been aloft half of that
time. Now, on returning, the novelty had worn
off, and they were so much interested that they
forgot to look at their watches until the deep blue
haze, which betokened the approach to the sea,
aroused them.</p>

<p>"Why, it's past five o'clock," said Ralph.
"Tom was going for an hour's flight only," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"He just said that in fun, I suppose," replied
Ralph.</p>

<p>After alighting the boys did not know how to
fully express their appreciation of Tom's kindness
for the great treat, and they inquired whether
they could not be of some service to him, as they
were only too anxious to help him out in any way
that would be useful.</p>

<p>"Why, no; I don't know what I can put you at,"
replied Tom. "Of course, there's always lots to
do about the hangar, and the first thing to learn
is how the machines are built, and how to handle
them; and then, an important thing is to learn all
the tricks in a gasoline engine."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just what we want to learn," said Alfred,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"But I thought you had to go to Paris to meet
your father?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Alfred ruefully; "but we can
come back. I'm sure there will be no objections."</p>

<p>"Of course, it's your first duty to go to Paris&mdash;that
is, if you can get there," said Tom, rather
slyly.</p>

<p>There was now nothing for them to do but to
make an effort to reach Paris. Immediately after
landing, they started for the tram way, and
reached Dunkirk after six in the evening.</p>

<p>"I never was as hungry in my life," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Do you know why?" answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, we didn't get anything to
eat at noon," was Ralph's answer.</p>

<p>After alighting from the cars, their first mission
was to seek a restaurant, and from that point they
soon reached the post office, only to be again disappointed.
At the telegraph office they had the
same bad luck.</p>

<p>"I wonder where father is?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall have to go, whether we
want to or not," suggested Ralph. "Let us inquire
at the transportation office."</p>

<p>At the main office they soon learned that the
troops from England were occupying every coach,
motor wagon and bus that was in sight, and that
there was no encouragement in that direction.
But an idea occurred to Alfred.</p>

<p>"We belong to the army, don't we?" he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose we apply as soldiers, and tell them we
must get to Paris at once."</p>

<p>They reached the main office of the Army transportation
service, and boldly made their way to
the room indicated by an attendant. In a few moments
they were ushered in, and saw at least a
score or more soldiers and officers in the room, at
one end of which sat a white-haired officer, and
several other officers, issuing orders.</p>

<p>"Your business?" said an officer, approaching
them.</p>

<p>"We have been with the Belgians, and have just
come from Antwerp. We are Americans, and are
trying to reach Paris, and we wanted to know if
we couldn't go on one of the trains?" explained
Alfred.</p>

<p>The officer shook his head. "I am sorry to say
that we cannot provide for any one unless connected
with the army," he said.</p>

<p>"But we are connected with the army," said
Ralph. "We were messengers, and have had a
lively time, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, and we expect to join the flying corps, but
father expects me in Paris," said Alfred.</p>

<p>The officer smiled, and pondered a moment.
Then, motioning to them, he passed out of the
room, the boys following. They crossed the hall,
and entered a narrow room.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," he said, "issue a permit for
these boys to ride on any available train
to Paris."</p>

<p>The boys expressed their thanks to the officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and, after giving their names and home addresses,
they received a card, which stated that the Army
transport service permitted them to ride on any
train where there was available room, at the discretion
of the officer in charge of the train.</p>

<p>"I should advise you to see the officer at the
station in the morning, and get him to assign you
to a train number, as the quickest way," said
the clerk, as he handed them the permit.</p>

<p>"Nothing like determination," said Ralph. "It
is bound to pull you through."</p>

<p>It was too late for them to return to the aviation
field that evening, so after considerable
search, they finally found a room, and after discussing
the events of the day fell asleep, and
awoke long after the sun had risen.</p>

<p>"We've got to do some hustling," said Ralph.
"We ought to see Tom this morning and tell him
of our good luck."</p>

<p>They partook of a hasty breakfast, and were at
the station in order to get an assignment. But
this was not an easy matter. They waited for
nearly two hours before they were able to reach
the proper official.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that we cannot take you today,
but I will try to make a reservation for you
tomorrow. Come here after four this afternoon,"
said the officer.</p>

<p>"Now for the aviation field," said Alfred.</p>

<p>They were detained for more than an hour
watching several newly arrived regiments embark
on a train, which slowly pulled out to the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and it was nearly noon when the grounds were
reached. There seemed to be a change in the
place. The hangars were empty, and no machines
visible. A score of men were taking down the
temporary hangars and from them it was learned
that the entire corps had started at eight o'clock
for the southern station.</p>

<p>"That's too bad!" said Ralph regretfully. "I
wish we had started back earlier."</p>

<p>"Then we might go to the hospital," suggested
Alfred.</p>

<p>The head surgeon remembered the boys. "It's
too bad," he said. "Lieutenant Winston has been
removed to the hospital at Dunkirk, and will leave
for England tomorrow; but his sister is still here,&mdash;ah,
here she comes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to see you. Brother asked
for you before he left. If you are going to England,
you must go to see him. He is at Hempstead."</p>

<p>"We expect to go to Paris tomorrow, and we
are sorry not to be able to see him," Alfred
told her.</p>

<p>They at once returned to Dunkirk, and awaited
anxiously until four o'clock. Before they had an
opportunity to speak to the officer in charge, he
shook his head, to indicate that there was no room.
They lingered about, but it appeared to be a hopeless
task. Four tracks ran by the station office,
and these were constantly filled with empty cars,
then loaded up, and drawn out. They watched the
proceedings until the sun went down, when tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and hungry, they crossed the street, entered a coffee
house, and ate a hurried supper.</p>

<p>As they were moving out the doorway, Ralph
stopped. Turning to Alfred, he said: "We are
chumps; that's about the size of it."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"We have the permits, haven't we? Why are
we waiting for that fellow at the station to get us
an assignment?" replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's a fact; let's make our own assignment;
come on," answered Alfred. "Is this train going
south?" he asked, addressing a soldier who was
about to enter a half-filled compartment.</p>

<p>"Aw! I dare say it is," was the jolly response.</p>

<p>"Get aboard," said Alfred.</p>

<p>Unabashed, they swung themselves up on the
running board, and entered the compartment.
The occupants glanced at them for a moment, and
seeing the trim uniforms, at once became inquisitive.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to be directed to this
train?" asked one of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, we attended to that ourselves," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Our permit's all right, but we couldn't wait
for them to make up their minds when we ought to
go; so here we are," said Ralph, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, you fellows'll do; but it's a long way to
Tipperary," said a voice, which trailed off into
the tune of the well-known song. His companions
chimed in, and it was not long before the occupants
of the adjoining compartments joined in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the song. It was a jolly crowd, but no one seemed
to know where they were going. All had heard
of the rapid advance of the Germans toward Paris,
and that General French was trying to impede
their advance somewhere to the south.</p>

<p>It was fully nine o'clock that night before the
train made a real start. Before that time they
were pushed around on the various sidings for
an hour, and it was a relief to see the fields and
feel the continual motion of the train as it finally
speeded away.</p>

<p>There was no time for talk now. Each tried
to find a comfortable place in order to get some
sleep. They dozed and dozed, as most people are
liable to do in uncomfortable surroundings, and
some hours afterwards an orderly appeared at the
door, shouting:</p>

<p>"All out, men; form in ranks."</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall have to get out, too," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why, no; this can't be Paris," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"I know bally well it isn't," said a voice.</p>

<p>That settled it; tired and sleepy they swung off
the running board, and looked at the long lines
forming at the side of the train.</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are?" asked Ralph, addressing
a soldier at his side.</p>

<p>"Don't know, my boy; we've had a steady run,
though, for about three hours," was the reply.</p>

<p>"We are east of St. Quentin; we passed
through the city half an hour ago; this isn't much
of a hill we are on, but the Germans and French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
fought a battle on this very spot in the campaign
of 1870-1," said an officer.</p>

<p>Alfred saluted the officer, and asked: "How far
are we from Paris, sir?"</p>

<p>"I think it must be fully a hundred miles," was
the reply.</p>

<p>The men were ordered to line up, and soon the
order came to march. As the boys had no other
place to go, and the train was even then backing
toward the city, they marched alongside of the
column. The tramp was across open fields for a
half-mile, where a road was sighted, but it was
lined with troops, and heavy artillery, going eastwardly.</p>

<p>The column continued on, parallel with the road.
It was dry, dusty and warm. There was a hum
of sounds, and occasionally a boom or two, which
the boys recognized from their previous experiences.
The most emphatic voices were those of
the drivers, who were piloting the horses drawing
the artillery and caissons. An hour's march
brought them to a small stream, which was crossed
without waiting for boats or hunting for bridges,
as it was easily waded.</p>

<p>Across the stream they ascended an elevation,
at the crest of which was a line of soldiers busily
at work with spades and pick-axes. Trenches
were being formed. They were cheered by the
workers, but there was no halting. On they went
over level ground, only to meet another line of
men similarly engaged. Several hundred feet beyond
an order came like a shot: "Halt!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>An orderly came riding up at full speed, and
looked around. "We are waiting for orders, I
suppose," remarked a lieutenant.</p>

<p>The orderly put spurs to his horse, and rode
to the right, as he espied a group of horsemen.
"Form your men along this line, and dig in," he
directed.</p>

<p>The order was given: "File to the right; halt;
stack arms."</p>

<p>Several lorries, which had been following them,
came up, and at a word of command the men began
to unload shovels and picks. This began to look
like business. It was now growing light, but it
still lacked a half hour before sunrise.</p>

<p>"Why can't we lend a hand?" inquired Ralph.</p>

<p>"Of course we can," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>They were alongside in an instant. Ralph
jumped into the vehicle, and helped to hand out the
implements, while Alfred tried to edge his way
in. Their earnestness attracted the officer in
charge, and he smiled, and nodded his head in approval.
Thus two van loads were dumped out,
and carried forward of the rows of stacked
arms.</p>

<p>An engineer officer marked out the line of the
trench, and the men were set to work. They were
now doing the job for a <i>real</i> purpose, as during
their month of training in England these men had
been instructed how to go about the business of
making trenches, and it was wonderful to see how
quickly the furrows were dug out. They were
about four feet deep, the earth being thrown up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
on the side toward the enemy, thus making a
shelter trench five feet deep.</p>

<p>As soon as the main line was thus completed,
traverses were cut, leading out at right angle to
the rear of the main trench. These were formed
in zig-zag fashion, the object being to form shelter
sections along the entire trench, so that those
within would not be subjected to what is called an
enfilading fire.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER V</h2>

<h2>ON THE FIRING LINE</h2>

<p><br />"Look at the guns back there," shouted Ralph,
as the company marched back to get their first
breakfast after three hours of hard work.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys!" said the corporal in charge,
smiling at the boys. "You've worked pretty hard
for lads of your age; come and have something to
eat."</p>

<p>"So we will," said Alfred; "but what are the
guns doing back there?" he asked, as he pointed
out a battery which had limbered up and was
wheeling into position.</p>

<p>"You will see in a few moments," replied the
corporal, and before they reached the mess wagon
the guns began to roar.</p>

<p>"How far away are the Germans?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"About two and a half miles, I should judge,"
replied the corporal, looking at the battery.</p>

<p>"How can you tell by looking at the guns?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"By their angle," was the answer.</p>

<p>Before they ceased speaking, the first shot was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
fired, then another and another, all of them trial
shots, as one of the soldiers explained. Then another
battery to the left, heretofore unnoticed, began
to fire, while one posted higher up on the right,
and two more beyond, chimed in. This was a new
experience to the boys, as the Belgians, with whom
they had formerly associated, were lacking in field
pieces compared with those they now saw and
heard.</p>

<p>The challenge was promptly accepted by the
Germans, and within fifteen minutes the whole
crest to the east of them, probably two miles distant,
seemed to be ablaze. It was singular, however,
that none of the missiles fell near the troops
where the boys were located. On a little elevation
to the right of the kitchen vans the boys noticed a
group of officers with field glasses, intently scanning
the rear of their position.</p>

<p>"The blooming blokes are shooting too far," remarked
a soldier.</p>

<p>"Why are they doing that?" asked Alfred, who
overheard him.</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll get the range in time," he replied.</p>

<p>"There's the first airship, to give them a
pointer," said the corporal, as an airplane appeared
in sight.</p>

<p>"Two of our machines are coming up," shouted
Ralph. "Now there'll be a fight."</p>

<p>Ralph was right. The two English machines
steered straight for the oncoming Fokker, the latter
veering to the left in time to prevent too close
a meeting. Within a minute three more German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
machines came into sight, their appearance being
answered by four of their own machines, which
came up from the rear, and sailed straight across
above them to the German positions on the crest
of the hill. They were much higher than the German
machines, the reason being that the enemy
had a number of anti-airship guns to meet any
flyers who dared to cross the line at a low altitude.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, an interesting sight to observe
the numerous airplanes, which were employed by
the two forces. They seemed to be flying back and
forth in the utmost confusion, and, frequently,
puffs of smoke would indicate that they were firing
at each other.</p>

<p>The corporal with whom the boys talked seemed
to be unusually well informed, and quite a number
of the soldiers addressed him for information.</p>

<p>"How do they recognize an enemy?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's an easy matter," he replied. "I
suppose the flyers in the air do it on the same
principle that we are in the habit of recognizing
automobiles. Why, I have a lad not ten years old
who can tell the make of almost any auto the moment
he sees it. Generally, if the make of the
plane is similar to those attached to the aviator's
side he is able to recognize it by the special mark
it carries."</p>

<p>"What mark do you mean?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why, the English and the French mark is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the form of a circle, generally three, each circle
being of a different color," was the answer.</p>

<p>"There is one,&mdash;why, it's red, white and blue,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's correct,&mdash;those are the colors of the
Allies."</p>

<p>"What are the German colors?" asked Ralph.</p>

<span class="caption"><i>Allies&#39; Distinguishing Mark</i></span>
</div>

<p>"Black and white," said the corporal.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they have a cross," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; a cross in imitation of the iron cross, so
far as its shape is concerned," he answered; "that
is, a black cross on a white field."</p>

<p>The company marched back to the line. During
the next half hour there was nothing but expectancy,
waiting, waiting,&mdash;that most trying
thing for soldiers, who know that a battle is impending.
Then a hundred feet to their rear there
was a terrific explosion, which startled every one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
This was followed by others, but none reached
the trench line.</p>

<p>Thus, during the whole day, there was an exchange
of artillery, the greatest damage being
done to those in the rear who were trying to get
to the front.</p>

<p>"With the long range guns the great danger
isn't always with the fellows in front," said the
corporal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="500" height="276" alt="Black Cross on German Flyers" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Black Cross on German Flyers</i></span>
</div>

<p>At four that afternoon the company was startled
by an order to leave the trenches and fall to the
rear. Every one cast questioning glances, but the
knapsacks and rolls were quickly seized, and
within ten minutes they were in line with the regiments
to the right and the left. There was no
hurrying or disorder.</p>

<p>"I wonder why we are going back?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's our business to retreat," returned
the corporal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>They marched fully a mile to the rear, passing
on the way at least half a dozen lines of trenches,
which had been thrown up since the boys covered
the ground the night before. Every trench line
was filled with soldiers, those in the front being
the first to retire. On the way they saw how the
great shells had played havoc with many of the
works.</p>

<p>They again crossed the river, and at six o'clock
that night a new line was formed, and the spades
and picks were again brought into use. The booming
of cannon was incessant, and, although they
tried to get some sleep after midnight, they were
frequently aroused by the marching of troops.
At daylight they were again marched out of the
trenches, and a quarter of a mile from the last
trench halted to partake of breakfast.</p>

<p>The march was directly south, and at noon they
reached a town of some importance, called
Chauny. They went through without halting,
crossed the river Oise, and at four o'clock halted
on the eastern banks of a stream, which flowed
northwardly. Here they waited for orders. A
picturesque bridge spanned the stream, and the
boys wandered across. West of the river was a
broad expanse of country, perfectly level, and
thousands of people from the nearby villages lined
the road, all crossing to the west.</p>

<p>All were excited, and seemed to be going toward
the narrow road, which led to the left, and, naturally,
the boys followed the movement of the
crowd. Their curiosity was soon satisfied, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
beyond was a sight which caused their hearts to
beat with joy. Fully a dozen airplanes were
drawn up in line, and the boys started forward
on a run that seemed to instill the same activity
in many others present.</p>

<p>"There's a Morane," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that's Tom getting out of the machine,"
shouted Alfred, as they rushed up and
greeted Tom, who looked at them in astonishment.</p>

<p>"And how did you get here?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Came over with the troops," explained Alfred.</p>

<p>"With what troops?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know," answered Ralph, "but they are
from Essex."</p>

<p>"Well, we've been on duty for a day directly
over the lines east of St. Quentin," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Did you have a fight?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I should say we did," answered Tom.
"Brought down two, at any rate, and it was pretty
hot for about an hour. So you are on your way
to Paris; sorry you didn't get back before we
started," he added.</p>

<p>"We got to the grounds several hours after you
left," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Glad you came; we can put you up, if you are
willing," remarked Tom.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the invitation; we helped them
on the trenches and have done considerable marching,
so it's better than going back to camp," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>The boys were up early in the morning, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
didn't have the least idea what steps to take to
continue their journey. Everything in the way
of transportation was reserved for the troops.
Thousands of people were leaving their homes,
and people with household effects, mounted on all
sorts of conveyances, were noted on all sides, although
at this time the Germans were not within
ten miles of the river. The nearest railway to the
south, which ran east and west along the southern
bank of the river Aisne, was fully ten miles distant
from this point.</p>

<p>Tom was on hand early, and greeted the boys
most affectionately.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking I might be able to help
you out a bit," he said, after a little talk. "We
are ordered to the station near Villers-Cotterets,
and that's only forty miles from Paris."</p>

<p>"How can you help us?" inquired Ralph excitedly.</p>

<p>"Probably I can give you a lift in the machine,"
he said.</p>

<p>"How far is that from here?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Twenty miles," replied Tom, and the two boys
looked at each other hopefully, as he left them.</p>

<p>Tom re-appeared at three o'clock, and informed
them that they would start in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>"If you are ready for the trip, jump in and
make yourselves comfortable," he said, and they
required no second invitation.</p>

<p>The dainty Morane just suited them, and they
were in their seats in an instant. Tom then tossed
them a light package, which they tucked away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the engine began to buzz. As they glanced around,
two more machines seemed to vie with them in taking
the air, then, as they again looked around, four
more machines began to move, and soon all were
on the wing, flying side by side, excepting two
large Farman machines, which were well in the
lead.</p>

<p>Up, up, up, they went, the machines on line with
each other maintaining a height of about four
thousand feet, while the Farmans were about five
hundred feet higher. Within a half hour they saw
in the distance what appeared to be a silver ribbon
running east and west, which proved to be the
river Aisne, and to the east they saw the city of
Soissons. The beautiful aviation ground was
reached within an hour, and they alighted in front
of a magnificent group of hangars in the center of
well-tilled fields, so located as to afford a view in
all directions from the grounds. The machine was
then put up for the night, and Tom and the boys
were glad to turn in for a much-needed rest.</p>

<p>It was now the first day of September, and there
had been nearly one month of war. The immense
German forces had hewn their way through Belgium
and entered France, reaching the cities of
Laon, Epernay, and Chalons-sur-Marnek, thus
forming a huge circle. They were within forty-five
miles of Paris.</p>

<p>When the boys awoke the next morning the first
words that greeted them were: "The Germans
are within five miles of Soissons."</p>

<p>They rushed over to the hangar, but the machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and Tom were not to be found. This was
another source of grief to them, and they stared
about, and wondered at this new turn of affairs
until, meeting an attendant, Ralph inquired:</p>

<p>"Do you know where the Morane has gone?"</p>

<p>"They all started on a reconnoitering trip at
five this morning," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will come back here?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is doubtful," answered the man.</p>

<p>"Then we shall have to make our way to Paris
as best we can," said Ralph. "Do you think we
would have any chances on the railroad?"</p>

<p>"It's doubtful. I should take my chances over
the highway directly south, if I wanted to make
Paris," answered the man. Then, after a little
reflection, he added: "A large English force is expected
to be here from Laon, and it may arrive before
noon. Possibly the flyers will return, but if
the German forces are too close, they will go on
to the next station at Crepy, directly south of this
place."</p>

<p>"Then that's the place for us," proposed Alfred,
as he thanked their informant.</p>

<p>They had no trouble in getting breakfast and
after waiting for an hour, during which all sorts
of rumors were floating about, they concluded that
their only course would be to commence the trip.
It was not necessary for them to inquire the way,
as the highway, in the distance was filled with
fugitives, all trying to get to Paris, or, at least,
to avoid the invaders while there was yet time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching the highway, they moved along with
the procession, and, shortly before twelve o'clock,
reached Crepy, ten miles from Soissons. They
were now twenty-five miles from the center of
Paris, and after getting a good meal they again
took up the march over a beautiful road, which
ran southeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h2>VIGOROUS RED CROSS WORK</h2>

<p><br />A mile from the town they came within sight
of a cross road, filled with an immense concourse,
which seemed to be wending its way east. Approaching
nearer, they recognized troops, artillery
and horsemen, the latter moving along in the
fields parallel with the roadway.</p>

<p>"It seems to me the firing is much nearer than
when we started out this morning," said Ralph.</p>

<p>As they passed through the marchers, and proceeded
along the highway, they saw that troops
were noticed posted everywhere, and that batteries
were lying in wait in every advantageous spot.</p>

<p>"I think we made a mistake in taking this road.
We should have traveled the one which went to the
west," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Then let's go out the first road that crosses
this," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sounds of battle came nearer and
nearer. The artillery posted on the elevation began
to speak, and before there was time to realize
it the boys were within the battle zone, and bearing
down on the road along which they were traveling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
They had no trouble, however, in leaving
the road, as all the fences were down, and many
of the fields were cut up with the hoofs of horses,
and creased by the huge artillery wheels.</p>

<p>To add to the confusion, shells began to fall all
about them, and occasionally a terrific explosion
would follow, leaving them dazed and startled.
They ascended a hill, and, looking back, saw nothing
but dense clouds of smoke, and a scene of indescribable
confusion.</p>

<p>"What's that down there?" shouted Alfred,
pointing to a group of vans close by the side of a
stream.</p>

<p>"That must be a Red Cross station; so it is,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>Their footsteps were hurried, but before the
place was reached they saw stretcher bearers, and
also noticed the wounded being unloaded from a
field van. Glancing to the left they saw fully a
dozen vans of like character, as indicated by the
great red crosses on their sides, rushing up the
narrow street from the southeast.</p>

<p>"Let's give them a hand," said Alfred.</p>

<p>A business-looking surgeon stood at the rear
end of one of the vans, as the boys approached.
They saluted. "Can we do anything to help out?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at them for a moment, apparently
non-plussed at their appearance.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; we need you and many more willing
ones like you."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Alfred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The surgeon drew a pad from his pocket, wrote
a few words on it, handed it to the boys, and said:
"Present this to the officer yonder."</p>

<p>The officer indicated received the slip, while directing
the disposition of a wounded soldier,
glanced at it hurriedly, then looked at the boys.
"Ah, want to get on duty? We can accommodate
you; there, put those stretchers in the van. One
of you can take this to the supply van," he said.
Ralph seized the paper, and looked about.</p>

<p>"The van with the flag on it," explained the officer.</p>

<p>Ralph rushed across the intervening space, and
presented the paper to a Red Cross nurse, who
smiled sweetly as she glanced at the paper, and
looked inquiringly at Ralph. She then turned,
seized three packages, and handed them to Ralph,
while he thanked her and quickly rushed away.
The packages were stored in the van, water was
supplied to the containers in the vehicle, and the
moment the last article was on board, the van
started.</p>

<p>The boys were both within, as well as three men
and a surgeon. They had heard no orders, but
knew they were bound for the battlefield. There
was no talking indulged in. The men were too
intently engaged in listening to the din of the
conflict, and watching the soldiers moving to and
fro.</p>

<p>"Has there been much of a fight?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"They have been at it all morning," said one
of the men. Then, glancing at the boys, he continued:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
"But this is a bad place for you youngsters."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will regret it before you return.
The scenes are awful," continued the man.</p>

<p>"We know what it is," said Alfred. "We saw
the worst kind of fighting in Belgium."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus071.jpg" width="600" height="316" alt="French and German Flags" title="" />
</div>

<p>"We were with the English in the battle east of
Soissons, and had some experience there," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Aren't you English?" asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; we're Americans," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>At this point a lieutenant rode up alongside, and
shouted: "There has been a tough scrap at the
mill; we have driven the Germans back; take this
road down to the river; you will find plenty of
poor fellows there who will need you."</p>

<p>The French had made a terrific charge at this
point, and many were lying dead, where the van
slowed down, so as to give the surgeon and helpers
an opportunity to pick out the wounded cases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever there was a movement in a prone figure
the men stopped and made an examination. In
some cases the wounds were hurriedly dressed,
and the victim's position rendered comfortable.
In other cases the surgeon motioned to the helpers,
who quickly brought the stretchers, and carried
the wounded into the van.</p>

<p>On this single trip they attended, or gave first
aid to thirty, but only the most severely injured
were taken into the van, which now turned and
quickly speeded along the narrow road to the field
hospital. Reaching this station the men were carefully
taken out, their wounds re-examined, and
carried into a temporary shelter for a second operation
or treatment.</p>

<p>A huge van then arrived from the southwest.
Carefully and tenderly eight men were placed on
the cots within, the boys being delegated to assist.
When the order was given to leave, the boys
remained in the van, as it started out on its journey,
but they didn't have the least idea where it
was bound, although you may be sure they were
curious to know.</p>

<p>After every one had settled down,&mdash;that is, if
such a thing as quiet and comfort were possible
in a van load of wounded men, Ralph turned to
the surgeon, and said. "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"To Paris, if we can get through," was the reply.</p>

<p>The van had a wonderful set of springs, so that,
although it was necessary hour after hour to go
through fields, instead of traveling along the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
there was little discomfort to the wounded men.</p>

<p>"Why are the men being taken to Paris?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"So as to relieve the emergency station behind
the battle front," explained the surgeon. "That
is one thing; the other is, that the great German
forces are driving in our comparatively small
army, until the Paris forts are reached. There
they will be stopped, and we must take our
wounded with us, and out of the reach of the enemy."</p>

<p>At Dammartin they saw the first Red Cross railway
van,&mdash;an entire train load, filled with wounded
from the emergency stations, and here also they
were joined by fifteen vans taking the wounded on
to the city. It was thus a fortunate stroke for the
boys that they undertook to help the field hospital
workers, for it directly assisted them in their effort
to reach the end of their journey.</p>

<p>Traveling was slow, and many detours were
necessary, so it was not until the fourth day of
September that they caught sight of the walls of
Paris, and they soon had the pleasure of driving
over the beautiful smooth streets again. They
went directly to the center of the city, passed down
the rue de l'Op&eacute;ra, through the Place de la Concorde,
and over the bridge to a hospital near the
Place des Invalides.</p>

<p>Their charges in the van were soon provided
for, and carried into comfortable berths. As they
were leaving the ward, they heard a weak voice
calling: "Ralph; Alfred."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>They were startled, and turned around with
wondering glances. A nurse motioned to them,
and pointed toward a figure with bandaged head
and arms. They approached.</p>

<p>"You don't know me, I suppose?" said the
voice.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;no," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"I believe it's Tom," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Right," said the voice.</p>

<p>The boys knelt down at his side at once. "How
did it happen?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, they got me first; but I brought down
two of them before I was hit," Tom told them.</p>

<p>"What became of the machine?" was Alfred's
next question.</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything about it," was the
reply, "but they told me it made fine kindling
wood."</p>

<p>"Too bad!" consoled Alfred. "I liked that little
Morane; and to think it's all broken up."</p>

<p>"How did you get here?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Why, we came down with the Red Cross people,"
explained Ralph.</p>

<p>"You seem to get into all sorts of trouble, all
along the line," said Tom with an attempt to
laugh.</p>

<p>"But are you badly hurt?" inquired Alfred
anxiously.</p>

<p>"The doctors say that there are only a few
bones broken, several joints wrenched out of
shape, and some of the bark peeled off, but I ought
to be out in a few weeks," said Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell us what we ought to do now?" Alfred
asked him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, I want to know whether they will expect
us to keep on in the Red Cross service?"</p>

<p>"You volunteered, didn't you?" replied Tom.
"You helped them out of your free will, and you
can leave whenever you want to, if that's what you
are getting at."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind volunteering in the aviation
corps," said Ralph. "I would just like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So they got you this time, eh?" said a voice.</p>

<p>The boys turned, and saw a handsome man with
the uniform of a lieutenant in the aviation service,
who approached, and leaned over Tom. Tom
replied with a smile, and raising his injured hand,
pointed to the boys.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," he said, "I want you to get acquainted
with two of my American friends, who
have been in the thick of it right from the start.
Now you'll be conferring a special favor if you
can take them in to help you out. Oh, they're
bricks," continued Tom, as he saw a shade of discouragement
in the lieutenant's features, "they
are made of the right stuff."</p>

<p>"We leave for Verdun in the morning," said the
lieutenant, "but I will see what can be done in the
meantime."</p>

<p>As they left the hospital the first thought was
to go to the Continental Hotel to try to get a trace
of Alfred's father. Arriving there a letter was
handed them, together with two telegrams from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Berne, Switzerland, one of the messages having
been received that very day. The missives informed
him that his father had not been able to
leave German territory until the twenty-eighth of
August, and as he had received word that the Germans
were approaching Paris he thought it unwise
to make the trip to that point, but would
await word from them before deciding what to do.</p>

<p>"How far is it from Berne to Verdun?" Alfred
asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"About three hundred kilometers," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Let's see; that's about two hundred miles,"
said Alfred. "And it's a hundred and fifty miles
to Verdun.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go to Verdun," said Ralph. "But
how?"</p>

<p>The subject was debated for an hour, when it
was decided to return to the hospital. They had
forgotten to learn the lieutenant's name, although
probably Tom knew how to reach him, they reasoned.</p>

<p>Arriving at the hospital they learned that Tom
was asleep, and that no one would be permitted
to see him, so they wandered around without the
slightest idea what course to pursue. They even
discussed the feasibility of walking to Verdun, but
that idea was soon abandoned.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the aviation grounds are?"
remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>They soon learned that several corps were located
at the great race course in the Bois de Boulogne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and they were soon on the underground
railway speeding to the nearest station in that
vicinity. Arriving at the grounds they approached
the entrance, and their hearts sank as
they saw a great crowd gathered, and one after
the other turned away.</p>

<p>"Chances of getting in seem to be pretty slim,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, we might try it, anyhow," said Ralph,
as he pushed forward.</p>

<p>They marched up to the gate, and passed
through without the least objection on the part
of the guards. This was the greatest surprise to
both. They had forgotten that the uniforms they
wore gave them admittance without question.
Evidently they were taken for army messengers.</p>

<p>"See that American flag?" shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's the place for us," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they lost no time in making for the
hangar on which the emblem appeared. They saw
a Farman machine partly outside of the hangar,
and in the body of it was seated a ruddy-faced
chap.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Came over to help you out," said Alfred.</p>

<p>He looked down, and slowly said: "You did,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, we've seen a little active service at the
front, so far," explained Ralph, "been in battle
several times, have been captured by the Germans,
helped to build trenches, worked with the Red
Cross people, and had a few flights in an airplane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and as we like aviation business best of all,
we thought we'd come over and go to work."</p>

<p>The airman raised himself, sat down on the
side of the car body, and commenced to laugh, although
Ralph's remark was said without the least
tinge of pride or boasting. Several from the adjoining
hangars came in to learn the cause of the
boisterous mirth.</p>

<p>"Well, that's fresh enough to come from real
American boys," he said, after he had sobered
down a little.</p>

<p>"That's right; we're from the United States;
we came here because we saw the flag on the outside;
what shall we do the first thing?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"From America?" said the man, climbing down
from the machine. "And you are regular Yankees?
Well, well; that's too good! I'm something
of an American myself. By jingo, you're
the kind of fellows to have around. Want a job?
Where did you get your uniforms? They look all
right."</p>

<p>"Oh, these are Belgian uniforms. We were
with them, you know, and had a pretty hot time,
too," said Ralph.</p>

<p>This information, as they now knew, was the
best credential possible, and they were soon the
center of an admiring crowd. Somehow the determined
matter of fact and positive way which
the boys adopted had the effect of winning their
way, and it was thus that they had the satisfaction
of entering a service which it is a most difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
thing to do even with the best credentials.</p>

<p>The happiness of the boys was complete when
their new friend told them to get up on the machine,
and help him to take out the engine. Coats
came off in a hurry, and they looked around for
some substitute to protect their clothing.</p>

<p>Their friend supplied the necessary articles at
once remarking as he did so that he ought to know
their names.</p>

<p>After this information was supplied, he remarked:
"My name is Martin; Bill Martin, Fifth
Aviation Corps; don't forget the Corps or you
may have trouble in getting into the grounds;
and, by the way, how did you happen to get
through?"</p>

<p>"If you mean the gates, why, we just walked
right through," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Just as though you had a right to do so!" said
Martin, as he again commenced to laugh. "You
said you were up in an airplane; where was that?"</p>

<p>"Up at Dunkirk, and back of the firing line,
south of the St. Quentin," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Do you know Tom Watkins?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Do I know Tom? Why, we came over together;
poor fellow, he got a bad fall," said Martin.</p>

<p>"We heard about it and saw him at the hospital
today," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"You don't say? So you've been flying with
Tom? I'm glad to know that," said Martin, as
he nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2>BOUND FOR VERDUN</h2>

<p><br />For three days more the boys wandered about
Paris,&mdash;three days of the most fearful suspense;
and then began the battle of the Marne. Every
airplane in and about Paris was at the front, on
the line somewhere, and the boys were deprived
of the opportunity to see the new friend they had
made at the Bois de Boulogne station.</p>

<p>They were so sure of being able to go to Verdun
that Albert wrote to his father of their plans,
in the hope that he would consider it wise to leave
Switzerland for that point, where they might meet.</p>

<p>The Germans had been defeated; Paris was
safe, the French line having held firmly all the
way to Verdun. The determination to go there
was firmly fixed in their minds, but they could see
no way to accomplish the purpose. A visit to
Tom at the hospital only resulted in their being
told that the lieutenant was in the field, no one
knew where.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," said Ralph, as they emerged
from their room one morning.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"We might get attached to the Red Cross some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
way, and that would be sure to take us to the
front," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"That would be just as hard as to get in with
the flying people," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"That may be so, too, but I can't see any other
way."</p>

<p>They again called at the Continental Hotel in
the hope that there might be some further news.
To their surprise they found a letter from Alfred's
father with a check for their personal expenses.
While reading the letter they overheard
a conversation which gave them the solution, as
they thought, of their difficulties.</p>

<p>"No," said a voice, "they will not ticket us to
any point near the firing line, but we might go to
St. Dizier, and from there work our way north."</p>

<p>"Good idea; let's book at once," said the second
voice.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Alfred. "That's the right
tip. Let's find out where St. Dizier is."</p>

<p>The clerk informed them: "It is about a hundred
and sixty miles east of Paris."</p>

<p>"Then it can't be far from Verdun," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Sixty miles southwest, I should judge," was
the answer.</p>

<p>"Do you think we would have any trouble in
reaching that point?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I think the trains are still running, but they
may not adhere to the regular schedule. The line
runs south of the war zone, you know," said the
clerk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>That settled it. They hurried to the Banque
Fran&ccedil;aise, and having secured currency for the
check, started for the booking office as fast as
they could walk. It was impossible at this time
to get a conveyance as only the underground railways
and a few tram cars were in service, the
government having requisitioned all the horses,
and automobiles a week previous to this time.</p>

<p>They booked second class, the official stating
that the tickets were sold at the risk of the holders,
and that they would have to take their chances
on the trains, so they were at the eastern railway
station before one o'clock, in the hope that the
regular through train at two that day would be
able to accommodate them. In this they were disappointed,
so they waited about until five o'clock,
and had the good fortune to have the tickets accepted
by the gateman.</p>

<p>They passed through an immense crowd of
newly arrived soldiers, and were jostled about by
hosts of men, women and children who were departing
for the southeast, most of them bound
for Chaumont. Within an hour they finally found
a train bound for their destination, but it was another
hour before the train began to move.</p>

<p>The trip was a weary one all through the night,
as they seemed to stop at every station, although
it was the fast express. The intense excitement
of the people all along the line; the passing of
trains; the crying out of the latest news; and the
bustle of the new arrivals in the already crowded
compartments, made sleep impossible. The sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
had been up two hours before the station of St.
Dizier was announced.</p>

<p>The boys were out and scampering along the
platform ahead of most of the crowd. As they
passed out the end of the station they noticed a
sign on a train: "For Bar-le-Duc, 10 o'clock."</p>

<p>"Let's see where that place is," said Alfred.</p>

<p>The information was obtained. It was twenty
kilometers northeast.</p>

<p>"That's the place we must go; it's twenty miles
toward Verdun, and now is our time," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Let's have something to eat first," said Alfred.</p>

<p>After the meal they booked for Bar-le-Duc, and
this train started promptly. Only two coaches
were reserved for civilians, the others being filled
with soldiers. The town, which was reached
shortly before noon, had the appearance of an
armed camp. Here they received the startling
news that the Germans were at St. Mihiel, thirty-five
miles northeast of that place.</p>

<p>There was no sign of panic there, however.
Verdun, Toul and Nancy were still intact, and
there was no fear that either place would
yield.</p>

<p>Before they had been in the city an hour they
saw a dozen or more airplanes overhead, and it
was not long thereafter until they learned that
one of the most famous stations belonging to the
flyers was located north of the place. A conveyance
was readily obtained, as a line of busses paralleled
the railway track, and in another hour they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
were on the plateau where the great hangars were
located.</p>

<p>As they were crossing the field, and approaching
the first tier of hangars the boys noticed the
two men whose conversation had been overheard
in the Continental hotel. "They are the very
men," said Alfred; "I wonder what they are here
for?"</p>

<p>The men stopped and looked at the boys for an
instant. Ralph approached them and said, with
a smile: "You beat us here after all."</p>

<p>The men appeared to be puzzled at being thus
addressed. Alfred saw that they did not understand
Ralph's greeting, and said: "We are under
obligations to you for telling us how to get here,
and I want to thank you."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly understand," said one of the
men.</p>

<p>"We heard you talking about making this trip,
and as we wanted to get to the front without knowing
just how to do it, your conversation helped us
out," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you're American boys," said one of
them, laughing.</p>

<p>"Indeed, we are," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Belong to the service?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Ralph,&mdash;"that is, we did
belong to it."</p>

<p>"Which branch?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Messenger service in Belgium, aviation and
trench service with the English, and Red Cross
in the French army," answered Alfred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>This response was answered by hearty laughter
on the part of both men, and one of them responded:
"That is a pretty comprehensive service,
I should say."</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"New York," answered Ralph. "Why, you
look like Americans, too."</p>

<p>"We're from the same place," was the answer.</p>

<p>"And you look like newspaper men," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's a good guess," was the reply. "But
how did you know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I saw you taking notes as we walked across
the field," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"Good inference," he replied. "Are you looking
for a job?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're going into the aviation service,"
answered Ralph, with all the assurance of a winner.</p>

<p>"See you again," was the final reply, as the two
men left them.</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder if they have any American flags
at this place?" remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>They marched back and forth without a sign
of that much desired emblem. At one of the hangars
two men were tugging at a machine, and
slowly bringing it out of the hangar. Without a
word the boys sprang forward and assisted in the
operation, an act which brought thanks from the
men. Then, more in curiosity than anything else,
they slowly walked around the machine and examined
its construction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The aviator watched them for a few moments.
Evidently, to his mind, the boys knew all about
flying machines, or, at least, must have had some
acquaintance with them. This seemed to interest
him, and he began a conversation with them. He
soon learned their history, and bestowed words of
praise on them for what they had done.</p>

<p>"So you want to be aviators, eh?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we'll do anything to get in," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"To be aviators in the service of the Government
it will be necessary to take the Regulation
course," said the man.</p>

<p>"There isn't time for that," said Ralph. "We
can help out now, even if we don't do any flying,
can't we?"</p>

<p>The man chuckled. "I suppose you can tighten
up bolts, examine, and stretch the stay wires, and
things like that?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"As well as take out the engine and overhaul
it," added Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; that's a pretty good job; do you
think you could do that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; we know something about it," replied
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, stay around here; we want some handy
fellows; but I'm afraid you'll have a hard job
to get on the pay roll," he added.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that end of it; we want to
be doing something; that's the main thing," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>It would not be interesting to go through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
long details of work that the boys entered into
under those circumstances. Each day for more
than two months the boys found plenty of work to
do. They became general favorites at the camp,
and while their services were not recognized in an
official way, as the regulations did not permit of
the employment of minors, still, in view of the fact
that they had such an interesting history, and had
entered into the work with such zest the commandant
at the station permitted them to remain, and
eventually provided them with rations and quarters,
to which was added a small pay, such as attached
to those in the messenger service.</p>

<p>During this period the boys had many opportunities
to go aloft on practice drills, and on more
than one occasion they had the privilege of operating
the machines while in flight, accompanied, of
course, by the regular pilots. Attached to the station
were a half-dozen machines used for the purpose
of teaching control, and to enable pupils to
become familiar with the handling of the machines.
They were designed merely to skim the ground,
the power being so limited that they could not be
raised from the ground except for very short
glides. These the boys frequently used, and the
experienced aviators were greatly pleased at their
wonderful progress. It was a strict rule, however,
that none but regularly licensed aviators should
pilot the government machines, and that prohibited
them from handling the machines on regular
service.</p>

<p>It was during the second week of the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
month that the boys had the first opportunity of
showing their capabilities. During a trial flight
with sub-lieutenant Guyon, while at an altitude
of five thousand feet, Ralph noticed the machine
dart downwardly, and, glancing back, saw Guyon's
head fall forward, and his hand drop from the
lever.</p>

<p>Without waiting to inform Alfred he crawled
out of the pit, and seizing the control lever,
pushed it back in time to bring the ship to an even
keel. Alfred saw the motion, and followed Ralph.
Together they succeeded in drawing the pilot to
one side, thus enabling Ralph to let himself down
into the position which enabled him to handle the
lateral controls, that were operated by the
feet.</p>

<p>With Ralph thus fully in control of the machine,
Alfred turned his attention to poor Guyon,
who tried to raise his head, and occasionally
gasped, as though trying to recover his breath. It
was not until the machine was nearing the earth
that he opened his eyes, and seemed to realize his
position, but he was too weak to give any instructions
or render assistance.</p>

<p>Ralph made a good landing, and the moment
the machine ceased to move Alfred jumped from
it, and ran to the office of the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Something is the matter with the lieutenant!"
he cried, as he entered the door.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble? Where is he?" asked the
surgeon, as he moved out of the door in response
to Alfred's appeal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was taken sick while we were in the air,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"And how did you happen to get down safely?"
asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>"We took charge of the machine," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Who are <i>we</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ralph and myself; we were up with him."</p>

<p>The lieutenant was being taken from the machine
when the surgeon arrived. Restoratives
were at once applied, and within a half hour the
attack seemed to wear itself away, and he began
to show a normal color.</p>

<p>His eyes rested on Alfred when he awoke from
the first quiet nap, and raising his hand approvingly
said: "That was a good job, Alfred; couldn't
have been better."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"You brought us down all right, I mean," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph did that," was the reply of Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, no matter; you fellows didn't get rattled;
that's the main thing," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>An incident of this kind could not remain a
secret long in a camp of this character. The Commandant
took particular occasion to commend
them for their performance, and it was a long step
in their favor when the corps moved to the north
to take its place in the great aviation camp directly
south of Verdun.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2>AN AEROPLANE AMIDST THE LIGHTNINGS</h2>

<p><br />Two days after the occurrence related in the
preceding chapter, the first section of the Corps
was ordered to proceed to the Verdun station.
Lieutenant Guyon belonged to this part of the
force, and, as he had now recovered, was instrumental
in securing the assignment of the boys to
his care.</p>

<p>"Then we can go along?" asked Ralph, with
some doubts and misgivings, as they were packing
the belongings of the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I have arranged that," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Alfred, who appeared at
the door of the hangar.</p>

<p>"We are going," shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; you might as well get your things packed
and put them in the machine," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The boys laughed, for outside of a few trinkets,
and underclothing, they had nothing of importance
to take along. They remarked that it was singular
how few things seemed to be really needed,
traveling, as they did, from place to place at a
moment's notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"When do you intend to start?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Whenever we are ready," was the reply.
"We intend to leave in squadron formation and
manoeuver for an hour, and afterwards each is
to make for the station on his own hook."</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the first signal was given.
The machine was pushed out and lined up. At the
second signal the machines were mounted. At the
third tap the motors began to hum, and soon there
was a movement in the whole line. It was a splendid
spectacle, as the machines left the ground, and
rose majestically toward the west, the direction
from which the wind was blowing.</p>

<p>The manoeuvers were particularly interesting
to the boys, and the lieutenant led his section in
the formation during the entire practice until the
captain's flag on the great Duperdessun indicated
that the machines were free. After making a
great sweep to the west the lieutenant turned to
the left, encircling the town, and pointed due
east.</p>

<p>Before they had proceeded fifteen kilometers,
something happened to the engine, for it ceased to
hum. They were then at an altitude of a mile, and
inability to start the motor made it necessary for
them to volplane to the earth. Sighting a considerable
town to the left, which was located south of
a canal, the machine was directed toward a
smooth, open field, not far from the environs, and
after landing they learned that the place was Ligny-en-Barrois.</p>

<p>It was found that through some accident the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
petrol tank had started a leak, and that the liquid
was slowly oozing out during the flight, without
giving the first indication until the engines failed.
It was just the kind of an accident which necessitated
the removal of the reservoir in order to make
the proper repair.</p>

<p>"Which is the fastest machine?" asked Alfred,
while they were waiting for the return of the reservoir.</p>

<p>"The Morane, by all means," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I thought the Caudrons were the best?" remarked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"It depends on what you mean by <i>best</i>," answered
the lieutenant. "The different machines
are used for various purposes, and while speed is
important, there are other things just as necessary."</p>

<p>"What other things?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, bomb-dropping for one thing; then,
some machines are better adapted than others for
directing artillery fire, or for using machine
guns," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"The captain has a Caudron," said Alfred,
"and he doesn't use a gun on it either."</p>

<p>"No; the Caudron is admirably adapted for observations,
and is used almost wholly in France
for directing artillery fire," answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that this machine is good for
observing," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; and it is used for that purpose, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
now being put to use for photographing purposes,&mdash;that
is, most of the Maurice Farman types are
so used," answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Why is that?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"For two reasons; first, because you will see
we can get a good view downward; and, second, because
it is the most stable machine in flight, the
latter making it especially well adapted to take
good views," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Which are the largest ships?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The Voisin and the Breguet, by all means.
They are able to carry heavy loads, and are used
as bomb-dropping machines, as their fuselages are
especially well adapted to carry and release the
missiles," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"But I saw a Voisin at one of the hangars
which had a big gun on it," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Ah, that was the Voisin Cannon, which carries
a 37-millimetre gun," said the lieutenant. "That
is used for bombarding captive balloons and Zeppelins,
if the latter should ever make their appearance."</p>

<p>"A 37-millimetre gun?" repeated Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's about one and a half inch in your
measure," answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Within an hour the reservoir was again in position,
and there was no delay in again mounting
into the air. "We might take a little trip due
east, as far as Toul, and north of that point we
may have the privilege of seeing some of the enemy,"
remarked the lieutenant, as they mounted
the machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>A beautiful silver thread now appeared on the
landscape to the east, as they reached their greatest
altitude. Looking back there was a smaller
thread to the west, and, apparently, the same distance
from their viewpoint. They thus had the
opportunity of seeing, at one glance, two of the
most noted rivers which figure in the great war,&mdash;the
Meuse to the east, and the Marne in the west,
these streams at this point being within thirty
miles of each other.</p>

<p>It was, probably, imprudent for them to take an
out-of-the-way course to reach their destination,
but the temptation was very great. The sun was
still shining brightly when they started from Ligny-en-Barrois,
but it was now growing dark from
the overspreading clouds, and as soon as Toul was
sighted the lieutenant turned the machine northward.</p>

<p>To the west it could now be seen that the threatening
clouds were coming up, and they appeared
to be sweeping toward the east with great speed,
at right angles to the aviators' course.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the lieutenant will do?" queried
Ralph half to himself, as he looked at the clouds,
and then glanced back to the officer.</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head, and pointed the
machine further to the left.</p>

<p>"Why, I believe he is going right into it!" remarked
Alfred in amazement to Ralph.</p>

<p>But the officer now made a wide swinging turn.
A view of the heavens indicated that the storm was
an extensive one, and that the speed of the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
had increased most alarmingly, for, in looking
down they seemed to stand still over the little hamlet
beneath them. The wind, into which they were
flying, was traveling at the same speed as the machine.</p>

<p>There was but one course to follow. They must
return to the earth, otherwise they would be
driven far over into the German lines. By setting
the control lever so as to depress the nose of the
machine they rapidly descended, the lever being
intermittently drawn back to a normal position,
so as to keep the ship on an even keel and prevent
it from performing a loop in the air.</p>

<p>The landing was easily made, notwithstanding
the wind, and they found they were near Commercy,
west of the Meuse, about thirty-five miles
south of Verdun. A terrific rainstorm then followed,
which lasted more than an hour.</p>

<p>"Were you ever in a rainstorm while flying?"</p>

<p>"Never but once," replied the lieutenant, "and
that was in thunder and lightning, too, which was
the most terrific thing I ever went through."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it!" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"I almost shudder at it when I stop to think of
the hour when I faced the lightning right where it
is made," said the lieutenant. "It was in the second
week of the war, just east of Rheims, when
the Germans were sweeping across the frontier
and had passed Charleville. I had a double-seated
Nieuporte, with an assistant handling the machine,
while I was making observations.</p>

<p>"Shortly after getting the first glimpse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
moving German columns I noticed that it was
growing dark, but when you are aloft that is not
noticed as quickly as when on terra firma. The
great hosts of Germans interested me intensely,
and we kept on until I estimated that we were
fully ten miles behind the advance columns, when
my assistant shouted through the tube: 'Look
back; what are your orders?'</p>

<p>"I saw that to continue would be disastrous, so
I gave the order to turn. This gave us the first
opportunity to determine our speed, or, to state
it more accurately, the speed of the wind, for you
will recall that when we turned this afternoon,
we seemed to stand still above the town.</p>

<p>"Within ten minutes of the time I turned the
machine to the west the first heavy rolling clouds
seemed to meet us. The earth was quickly blotted
from sight, and heavy rumblings were heard, but
no indications of lightning. I knew that heavy
black clouds were dangerous, and they were so
black that it was impossible to see my assistant,
three feet distant.</p>

<p>"I could not decide what to do, so I finally
shouted through the tube: 'keep on a straight
course to the west,' for I knew that to land at
that point would bring us right into the great
German column. There was no rain falling at the
time, but the cloud was like the densest mist. The
machine was still moving,&mdash;that is, the engine was
merrily humming, and my assistant's voice
startled me as he shouted: 'There is something
wrong; compass out of order.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"During the flashes I could see him pointing
to the compass, and I leaned over, and caught a
glimpse of the dial. The pointer was swinging
around violently. The lightning now seemed to
be incessant, and the rumbling of the thunders
was weird beyond description. Sometimes, immediately
after a vivid flash, a thick spray would
deluge our faces."</p>

<p>"What were you thinking about while all this
was happening?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"What impressed me most was the wonderful
difference between the appearance of those electrical
discharges when viewed in the usual way
from the surface of the earth. I did not notice any
forked lightning, nor did it show itself in streaks,
darting hither and thither. It seemed to be more
like balls of fire, suddenly appearing here and
there, and when each ball burst into flame, there
would be a crackling sound, at any rate, so it
seemed, for I dared not stop the engine.</p>

<p>"But the most remarkable thing was the odor
which was present. It had a pungent smell, not at
all unpleasant, but decidedly exhilarating in its
effects. I suppose we were taking in ample doses
of laughing gas, for I assure you that after the
first experience, we had no particular sense of
danger. It was most fascinating, and I felt as
though I was being raised up on my seat. Occasionally
I would try to figure out how this would
end, but on the whole it was devoid of terror."</p>

<p>"How long were you in the storm?" asked
Ralph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I was so fascinated that I had forgotten
to look at the watch. I held it before me, and soon
noticed that it was nearly five o'clock, so that we
were over an hour and a half in the thick of it.
During this experience what gave me the queerest
feeling was the compass, the needle of which could
not be seen, it swung around with such velocity.
Were we going with the storm, or not? That was
the thing uppermost in my mind. If we were being
carried along we might be even in Belgium by
the time I noted the watch.</p>

<p>"Then I tried an experiment. I ordered my assistant
to make a turning movement. This convinced
me that we were really going with the
storm, and were now far over into German territory.
Strange as it may seem, we were not thrown
hither and thither; the ship sailed along smoothly.
I feared to make the next experiment,&mdash;that is, to
direct the machine toward the earth, for, while
everything worked perfectly, I had a feeling that
it would be safer to reach the earth with an engine
running than with a dead one. Slowly the
machine went down; it seemed to get lighter, but
now the thunder came in sharp claps, and the form
of the lightning changed. I could distinctly see
what the observer sees when on the earth, long,
zig-zag streaks multiplied a hundred times more
than anything I ever witnessed while on earth."</p>

<p>"How high were you up when you got out of the
clouds?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and seventy meters (about
2,900 feet), as indicated on the barometer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Could you see the earth?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; the rain was pouring down; it
was splashing over us and all about us, and I signalled
to go up again, and we soon entered the
clouds; but during all this time the needle of the
compass kept spinning, so that we knew nothing of
the direction we were traveling."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you tell which way the wind was
blowing?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; we were moving with the great air current,
sometimes sailing with it, and at other times
against it, but with nothing below to indicate the
direction. We could not possibly say whether we
were going north or south."</p>

<p>"I think if I should be in the air and couldn't
see the earth I would know a way to tell which
way the storm was moving," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"How?" asked the lieutenant, as he leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Why, the rain would come down at an angle, if
the wind should be blowing, wouldn't it?" replied
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Quite true, that would be the case on the earth;
but it would not be so up where the raindrops are
being formed; there the little particles of water
move along with the wind stream; but that is not
all; when you are in a machine in a great wind
movement, the ship must move through the wind
in one direction or the other at all times so as to
keep aloft, hence, whether you are going with or
against the wind, the rain drops appear to be
coming down at an angle, and this, in itself would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
be sufficient to deceive you, or, at any rate prevent
you from determining the direction in which
you happened to be sailing."</p>

<p>"How did you get down?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That was the interesting part of it. After
a half hour more of flying I again ordered the
assistant to go down two hundred meters. It was
now evident that the storm was abating. Soon we
again passed out of the rain clouds, and the assistant
shouted that he had reached the level indicated.
'Go lower,' I shouted. As we did so it
grew lighter, and we began to feel a relief.
'Lower yet,' I ordered. At 600 meters the rain
poured steadily, but still nothing was visible."</p>

<p>"You were up then about a half a mile," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Just about that," was the reply. "Soon we
noticed a peculiar white patch, and then another.
This was puzzle to me. 'Go still lower,' I
shouted, and down went the machine. Then we
saw some white houses, and I almost shouted for
joy. But where could we be? We were passing
over a city, a city located within the bend of a
large river. I racked my brain to find out where
and what it could be. If it was the river Meuse
it might be Verdun, or Sedan, or Charleville. We
were forced to go down still lower, and then I
could see forts, and I felt sure we were over Sedan.</p>

<p>"We were even then going east. I was so agitated
that I could hardly speak, and motioned to
my assistant to turn around. He understood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the ship was swung around; we were now going
right into the blinding rain, but we were fifty
miles behind the German advance columns, and in
order to enable us to make more rapid progress I
told the assistant to change the course nearly due
south. We were flying very low, certainly not
over a thousand feet.</p>

<p>"Thus far we had not seen a soldier, or any
evidences of warfare. In a half hour we sighted
another stream. My heart leaped with joy, for I
was sure it must be the Aisne. To assure myself
of this we followed the stream for twenty kilometers,
and then the forests of Argonne came into
sight, thus assuring me of the position. I knew
that the army of the Crown Prince was in that region,
and it would not be safe to descend; I, therefore,
directed the machine to the west, crossed the
river, and was about to go still lower, when I heard
a boom,&mdash;several of them.</p>

<p>"This startled me, you may be sure. 'Up, up!'
I shouted. The machine obeyed. We rose to an
altitude of eight hundred meters, then suddenly
the engine stopped. My assistant turned and
shouted: 'We have no petrol.' I crawled back and
tested the tank. It was empty. 'Volplane to the
south,' I said. It was the only thing I could do.
Now that the engine was silent the sounds from
the earth were startling. There was terrific firing
to the right and left, and all about us; but we
must go down; there was no help for that.</p>

<p>"Soon the earth again came in sight, and then
the location of the batteries was made out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
volumes of smoke, which could be seen at each
volley. My assistant tried to hold up the machine
as long as possible, but we were now down to 300
meters, then the barometer registered 250. We
both noticed a large, apparently smooth field, and
the final volplane began. We landed a hundred
feet from a first-line trench, and although the Germans
made it hot for us for about fifteen minutes
we were soon able to reach the laterals and thus
escape their fire. But the machine was in a bad
condition when we rescued it that night. It was
literally shot full of holes. What is left of it is
now in the end warehouse where the scraps are
kept."</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2>A CHAPTER OF LESSONS ABOUT THE AEROPLANE</h2>

<p><br />Early the following morning there was intense
activity in the camp, and Ralph was among the
first to learn the cause of the excitement. Several
army divisions had come up in the night, and were
bound for the Verdun sector, and from the information
obtained it was the intention of the commander
to make a terrific assault in order to break
the German lines north of the city.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, when approached, admitted that
they were now in for double duty. "Every man
in the corps must report and be ready in the morning.
There will be two days of observation, and
then look out for some business."</p>

<p>"When will we go to Verdun?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"We are expecting orders at any moment," was
the reply.</p>

<p>During the previous afternoon more than fifty
machines had assembled, and some of those were
now leaving, a few going directly east, on observation
tours, while others were circling about and
testing the engines.</p>

<p>"I am expecting a big Farman machine," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Lieutenant Guyon, as he returned from headquarters
an hour afterwards, "that is equipped
for carrying bombs, but I am told it is one of the
speediest machines in the service. It will easily
carry six hundred kilos in bombs (1,200 pounds),
and we are ordered to wait here until it arrives."</p>

<p>When the boys were alone, Alfred, with a glint
of joy in his eyes, remarked: "I think that will
give us an opportunity to do some flying with the
lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" replied Ralph, elated at the
thought.</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," said a voice behind them.</p>

<p>They quickly turned and saw the lieutenant, who
had entered unobserved. They saw by the smile
on his face that the remark was an agreeable one,
for he continued:</p>

<p>"Yes, and the machine is now here; the men are
at work setting it up; so we might as well go over
and help out."</p>

<p>A second invitation was not necessary. Ralph,
who was outside in one bound, rushed across the
field, but Alfred accompanied the lieutenant to
the commandant's office, where they were provided
with the receipt for the machine. The lieutenant
remained here while Alfred carried the document
to the warehouse. Within two hours the machine
was in condition to receive the fuel and the supplies
usually carried in the machines for emergencies.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant returned he made a careful
inspection, and on this occasion the boys followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
every movement of his to learn what were
the essential requirements in inspecting. Naturally,
the most important thing was to know that
every part of the frame is not only properly set
up and the wires made taut, but that the fastenings,
the turnbuckles, are in good condition. That
necessitated a minute examination of every one
of them.</p>

<p>Then the planes were sighted to ascertain
whether they were properly aligned. Sometimes
when the planes are not exactly parallel with each
other, the end of one, for instance, being set a little
higher or lower than the other, it is usually corrected
by letting out one or more sets of brace
wires and taking up on others. This observation
was followed by a careful look at the control
planes. These are the sensitive parts of the
plane, and may be likened to feelers, for the slightest
warping of the horizontal tail planes will frequently
cause the machine to fly with a skidding
motion, not dangerous, but exceedingly uncomfortable
when flying at a high rate of speed.</p>

<p>"The wires leading to the control levers are always
a source of worry to me," remarked the lieutenant,
and he drew himself up into the rear part
of the chassis. "You will notice that this one rubs
along the side of that brace. I could not permit
that," he said, as he glanced toward one of the
workers.</p>

<p>"Do you think it would weaken the brace?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No, it's not that," replied the lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
"The difficulty is that all these wires are stranded,
and as soon as one of the wires wears out by the
frictional contact, another will give way, and the
control wire is liable to part at the most critical
time."</p>

<p>The boys had occasion to remember the lieutenant's
warning shortly thereafter. After an examination
of the airplane structure an investigation
was made of the engine. The mechanic turned
it over to be sure that the compression was all
right. Self-starters are provided on all these machines,
as the French learned at an early day that
it would be unwise to depend on cranking.</p>

<p>Then a thorough inspection of the pipes and
tubing for the fuel and lubrication was made.
The dashboard of an aeroplane is a much more
wonderful contrivance than the dashboard of an
automobile. The aviator must look out for several
things not necessary when traveling on land.</p>

<p>The machine which they were examining had on
it the most improved contrivances, which had been
found desirable, some of which were entirely new
to the boys, one of them being the inclinometer.</p>

<p>"That must be a dandy thing," said Alfred,
pointing to it.</p>

<p>"I think there are only a few of the military
machines which are supplied with them, but the
order has been given to put them on all the new
machines," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"What are the two rods for?" asked Ralph, as
he looked at the inclinometer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

1. Control Lever, with thumb switch. 2. Watch. 3. Altimeter, for registering height.
4. Compass. 5. Pressure Gages for two gasoline tanks 6. Dial to register engine revolutions.
7. Switches for two magnetos. 8. Air Speed indicator. 9. Clinometer. 10. Oil
Pulsator. 11. Gasoline supply system. 12. Engine crank and fly-wheel.</span>
</div>

<p>"The two rods which swing past the vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
bar, on which you see the numbers, indicate the
angle at which the machine is going. All that is
necessary is to observe the crossing point of the
rod over the marked bar, and it will instantly tell
what the angle of ascent or descent is. You see an
aviator now has so many things to think of that
he must have devices of various kinds which will
constantly tell him anything or any condition without
asking for it."</p>

<p>"Why, this also tells how fast the engine
turns," remarked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Of what use is that?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well; if you knew that the engine was capable,
under full throttle, to make eighteen hundred
revolutions a minute, and the dial showed
that the shaft was turning only one thousand, you
would quickly get the idea that something was
wrong," answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and then you would start to make an
investigation at once without waiting for the engine
to stop," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Exactly; it is there as a warning, just as a
headache is a warning that something is wrong, or
a pain, which is nature's way to indicate that an
investigation should be made without delay," answered
the lieutenant with a nod.</p>

<p>Besides the foregoing, the dash had on it a
watch. Now, a watch may be a convenient thing
to have on an automobile, but it is not a necessity.
On a scouting and observation plane it is
one of the necessary implements. Alfred laughed,
as he looked at the neat little clock face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "we could get along without
that."</p>

<p>"Of course we could," answered the lieutenant.
"But why get along without it when we now find
it such a necessary element?"</p>

<p>"Necessary how?" asked Ralph, in surprise.</p>

<p>"In determining distances, for one thing," answered
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"A watch to tell the distance?" asked Alfred
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," responded the lieutenant. "If
you saw a puff of smoke in the distance, and
shortly thereafter heard a boom, the distance
could be determined almost instantaneously by
roughly calculating 1,200 feet for every second.
You see, the clock there has a second hand, which
is very plain, for that very purpose."</p>

<p>"But suppose there is a regular battle on, it
would be hard to tell about the boom from any
particular gun, wouldn't it?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Quite true; in such a case it would be useless
for that purpose. Another use is in signaling,"
continued the lieutenant. "For instance, in sending
information to a battery, arrangement is sometimes
made to flash the distance by means of second
intervals."</p>

<p>"How is that done?" asked Alfred, now growing
intensely interested in the details of the dashboard
mechanism.</p>

<p>"It is an easy matter to signal numbers," answered
the lieutenant and a favorite plan is to fly
over the area where the enemy's battery is located,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
then flash at that altitude. The gunner will take
the angle, set his piece and fire, the aviator, meanwhile,
noting the course and effect of the shot.
By means of the watch he can determine the distance,
counting either by the time of flight of the
missile, or by the elapsed time between the flash
of the gun and the landing of the shot.</p>

<p>The altimeter is another very important part
of the equipment. It is a device which tells at
a glance how high the machine is flying, and Ralph
looked at it with a somewhat doubtful expression.
The lieutenant saw the questioning lines on his
face, and instantly divined the reason.</p>

<p>"You are in doubt whether the altimeter can
be relied on? Am I correct?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it is all right, but almost every
time we have been up and took the readings, we
found we were actually hundreds of feet less than
the altimeter actually showed, so I am wondering
if it is possible really to tell the exact height by
that apparatus," remarked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand what you mean," replied
the lieutenant. "The other day, when we made the
long flight from Bar-le-Duc, the device we had
showed 900 meters, for it was an automatically
registering barometer, as all of them practically
are. When we returned I noted on the report book
872 meters. Did you notice that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I wondered at it at the time," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"I knew that the general altitude of the country
at that place, as indicated by the topographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
charts, was 28 meters above sea level so I merely
subtracted 28 from 900, and that showed how far
up above the land we really were," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's a satisfaction to know how high
one is flying," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"It is not only a satisfaction, but it is an absolute
necessity for an aviator to know how high
he is flying, if his mission is to convey any information
to the batteries in the rear," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"And how is that done?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"By a system of triangulation," he replied.
"In a few days we may have an opportunity to
use the system, and I will explain it then so you
can quickly grasp the subject."</p>

<p>The air speed indicator was another interesting
device, but at that the lieutenant shook his
head as though doubting its general value.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's accurate?" inquired Alfred
of the officer.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it is as accurate as it can be made.
In fact all devices, which are used to indicate the
speed of the wind, are nearly perfect. That is not
the difficulty. When it is used on a flying machine
several new things enter into the problem, which
makes it difficult for the instrument to be truthful."</p>

<p>"What is the main trouble?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we are starting a flight against
a wind, which is moving at the rate of, say, ten
miles an hour," answered the lieutenant. "While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in flight we note that, going against the wind, the
air speed is sixty miles. Now, if we happened to
stop suddenly so we were poised in the air, the
indicator would show the air speed to be ten miles,
so that we were really going only fifty miles. If,
now, the machine is turned so that we are going
at right angles to the movement of the wind, although
we may be going actually through the air
at a speed of seventy miles an hour, the indicator
does not register the air speed at all, because it is
in such a position that the air does not affect it
and the only indication we have is the speed of
the air relative to the movement of the machine,&mdash;or,
to put it in a better way, I might say that the
instrument only registers, in reality, the speed at
which the aeroplane goes through the air, and no
more."</p>

<p>"But is that the only way to tell how fast we are
going?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The best test is to take the engine revolutions.
A certain machine after it has been properly
tested in a calm, and also in wind currents of different
velocities, will show a record of speed with
the engine running at certain revolutions. An experienced
aviator can judge pretty well, by experience,
what the speed of the wind is, and, knowing
the propeller speed, and the direction he is
going relative to the wind, he can make a fair estimate
of the speed of the machine."</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER X</h2>

<h2>A THRILLING EXPERIENCE IN THE AIR</h2>

<p><br />It was with feelings of joy that the boys stepped
out of their tent the following morning to learn
that the lieutenant had decided on a trial spin in
the forenoon, preparatory to the real start, which
was to take place at two in the afternoon. The
engine was turned over, and the machine held
down while the usual hour's running test was going
on. Everything seemed to be in order, the engine
was stopped and another inspection made
when the lieutenant gave the order to mount the
machine.</p>

<p>In this type of military machine the swivel gun
is at the extreme forward end, and the pilot directly
behind the gunner, and at a slight elevation
above the gun. Both gunner and pilot are housed
in, and in most cases strapped to the body of the
machine to prevent any accidental falling out, as
there have been numerous accidents due to men
being thrown from their perches.</p>

<p>The boys found ample room in the forward pit,
and at a word the machine was released and glided
forward. The new machine gave them a sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
different from the former one, as it appeared
to ride more easily and steadily. In fact,
there is just the same difference in the motion of
flying machines as there is in autos, some, the
small machines, seeming to glide over the ground
and impart every bump to the occupants, as might
be expected of a light machine.</p>

<p>A heavy flying machine, however, seems to
move along with the utmost ease, and does not
sway from side to side when sailing through cross
currents. Naturally, such a machine is a more
stable base for machine guns as well as for observation.</p>

<p>Alfred's particular hobby was kodaking. On
this occasion, the first time he had an opportunity,
he prepared himself with a camera. The lieutenant,
learning of Alfred's penchant in this direction,
had a regulation government instrument sent
over, and attached to the machine, to Alfred's surprise.</p>

<p>Before starting out, the lieutenant said: "I
want to give you some points now, in using the
camera. Photographs, in order to have any military
value, must be identified,&mdash;that is, they must
be made at such altitudes, and with reference to
certain marked characteristics on the earth, that
we may be able to place them on the topographical
maps of the particular section, and thus verify
them day after day."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by verifying them day after
day?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I mean by that to see what changes have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
place in the same view between the taking of the
two pictures," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Well, what possible changes could take place
in a day or two?" asked Ralph in astonishment.</p>

<p>"A great many, and very important ones, too,"
answered the lieutenant. "The camera sees what
the eye does not notice. If a picture is taken of
a certain section today, and the following day another
picture is snapped, a comparison of the two
will show whether or not there has been a movement
of troops, or, whether or not a certain undistinguishable
object was something movable, or
not."</p>

<p>"Is that the way the map of the enemy's country
is made up?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, and every detail is noted, so that when
you commence the work be careful to notice something
which will distinguish the exact place where
you are located; also put down the direction of
the flight over that same area, and the altitude at
which we are flying."</p>

<p>As the machine glided over the treetops and the
village on the northern border of the Meuse, the
sun shone out with intense brilliancy. They were
going directly east, and both boys turned toward
the lieutenant, their eyes seeming to say: "So
you are going to take a peep at the front, by way
of experiment?" which was exactly what the lieutenant
purposed doing.</p>

<p>The altimeter now registered 1800 meters, considerably
over a mile high. From that point they
could see to Verdun, and thirty miles east of Verdun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
could be noted the blurred outlines and surroundings
of Metz, that greatest of all fortified
German defences. On they went for nearly three-quarters
of an hour until a stream of some magnitude
appeared to the east, which they soon crossed.</p>

<p>They afterwards learned that this was the
Mosel, which flows through Metz. The latter city
now loomed up so it could be plainly seen, and to
their right was another town, Nancy, a fortified
French place. They were about midway between
the two places.</p>

<p>Suddenly an aeroplane appeared to the right,
and the lieutenant turned the machine in that direction.
The boys were relieved to see the great
circle on the control planes of the machine in the
distance, which showed them it was a French
reconnoitering airplane. In the east several other
machines were noticed hovering about, and the
lieutenant at first headed directly for them, but
he soon turned to the north.</p>

<p>Below were seen numerous flashes of guns, and
they knew from this that the fighting lines must
be along the river. The most startling thing which
occurred was a tremendous explosion that seemed
to be right in the machine itself, and they looked
around startled at the suddenness of it, for everything
seemed peaceful enough to them at that altitude.</p>

<p>The lieutenant turned the machine, however, as
he apprehended more trouble, now that the gunners
below had so luckily secured a fair range.
The first shot was followed in another moment by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
another, and the lieutenant now began to dart the
machine back and forth, and turn it in short, sharp
circles.</p>

<p>Another explosion took place, this time remarkably
close, and pieces of the flying machine came
down, and brushed past the boys. The lieutenant
shook his head, as the boys glanced back. The
machine was now circling around, a peculiar
manoeuver, the boys thought, as they looked at
each other for a possible explanation.</p>

<p>Ralph looked back, and noticed that the lieutenant,
with an alarmed look on his face, was constantly
glancing back to the tail planes. The steering
lever seemed to be jammed. Ralph had an
idea that something was wrong, and crawled over
the body until he was alongside of the lieutenant.
The latter pointed to the control lever, and Ralph
understood.</p>

<p>Without waiting for instructions from the lieutenant,
he cautiously made his way along the chassis,
following up the wires which were indicated by
the lieutenant. Within four feet of the tail plane
Ralph halted. Then, reaching down, he succeeded
in grasping a dangling wire, and held up the end
for the lieutenant's inspection. After several attempts
he found the other end of the wire, which
had been severed by a shot from a shrapnel shell.</p>

<p>The ship was still circling around, so without
waiting to repair the break Ralph turned the rudder,
and, glancing at the lieutenant, saw the latter
smile, and then by motions direct him to give the
control plane a still further push in the right direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
It was impossible for Ralph to hear anything
the lieutenant said, but as soon as the airplane
was fairly headed for the west, the power
was shut off, and the machine began to descend.</p>

<p>"Good boy!" shouted the lieutenant. "Can
you fasten them together?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," replied Ralph. "A piece
seems to have been shot away. But I can take
care of it if you will only direct me to pull it to
the right or to the left."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Do you see that great patch
of green, directly beyond the castle?" asked the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I can see it plainly," replied Ralph. "Shall
I steer for it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We must come up from the south.
Note the direction of the wind from the smoke.
Make a long sweep. We are now at an altitude of
1200 meters. We can volplane twelve kilometers
from this height," remarked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The turn was made to the south in a long sweep,
Ralph continually glancing forward to note the
direction indicated by the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Now straight ahead, and hold steady."</p>

<p>They were now rapidly approaching the earth;
the machine gliding over the tops of the trees at
the border of the forest that ran along the river
bank. To their right, across the river, was a large
town, Pont-a-Mousson, and the castle ahead of
them was a large school, from which even then
hundreds of children were emerging, and excitedly
rushing toward the approaching machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Down went the machine at a sharper angle;
then, when close to the earth, the rear control was
sharply turned, and the nose of the ship raised
up, but for an instant only, when the machine settled
down, and, after running along a hundred
feet, stopped.</p>

<p>The agitated children pressed about, and the
lieutenant tried in vain to keep them off. Some
more venturesome than others, after seeing Ralph
and Alfred, began to question them. To the relief
of the boys they learned that the French out-posts
were less than a mile distant.</p>

<p>"Let us make the repairs as rapidly as possible,"
said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>An examination showed that not only was the
control wire cut in two places, but the vertical
plane had its pivot shot away, thus accounting for
the peculiar action of the lever, which seemed to
jam whenever an attempt was made to turn it to
the right. Ralph did not know this, while seated
astride the body and manipulating the plane, and
it was obvious that even though he had succeeded
in splicing the wire, it would have been impossible,
with the rudder in that condition, to turn by means
of the wire controls.</p>

<p>Assisted by the machinist from the garage belonging
to the owner of the school, they completed
the repairs in an hour, and, hungry though they
were, they again went aloft and sailed for their
camp, which was reached after an absence of three
hours.</p>

<p>They thus had less than a hour to get a hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
meal and prepare to line up with the squadron, to
carry out the orders for the movement to the
north. They were now going to that section of
the fighting line in France where the most intense
struggles up to that time had taken place, and
where, ever since the opening of the conflict the
most stupendous operations were being carried
out to gain the mastery.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, the sight that met their
gaze, as they took their place on the extreme right
of the three squadrons, which were about to launch
on this memorable occasion. They were about
twenty miles south of the city of Verdun. The extreme
northern aviation base was not more than
eight miles southwest of the city, located on a level
plain east of the forest of Argonne, and close to
the Aire river, a tributary of the Aisne.</p>

<p>The trip was a short one, as the actual flying
distance was less than fifteen miles. Long before
they reached the scene of the great camp, they
could see the thousands of vehicles, and the hundreds
of thousands of soldiers, on the highways,
in the fields, and around the villages along the two
main railways which threaded their way along the
wide valleys between the Meuse and the Aire.</p>

<p>During every mile of the trip they were under
the constant vigilance of the officers, who moved
them into echelon, formed them into squares, or
caused them to trail in columns of two or three, the
object being to accustom the pilots to obey and
execute signals while in flight.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h2>A FIGHT AND A LANDING IN BELGIUM</h2>

<p><br />The day following their arrival at the field base,
as it was called, they found a wonderful change in
the order and arrangement of the place. Everything
was done in the most systematic way. So
many machines, from each squadron, were told off
each morning for certain duties. Those duties
were as follows: First, scouting. This meant ascertaining
where the enemy was most active;
where the batteries were located; noting the movement
of troops, and their general character.</p>

<p>Scouts generally operate in pairs, for if it is
impossible to signal back from the ships, one continues
the work while the other makes a signaling
report from such point or points in the rear as will
make the information useful.</p>

<p>The next duty is to protect the scouts from interference.
This work is carried on by the large
ships, which are usually provided with rapid fire
guns. They need not, necessarily, be speedy, for
they are to keep in touch with the speedy scout
ships, the latter of which sail around over a small
area so the observations can be carried on as
leisurely as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Third come the bomb-throwers, usually heavy-powered
machines, generally not armed, as all the
carrying power is devoted to the transportation of
bombs. These are also guarded by the heavily
armed machines. Sometimes, as in the case of the
Farman machine, which the lieutenant used, they
were used for scouting, and were also serviceable
for fighting purposes.</p>

<p>In the early period of the war there were not
many pilots capable of doing the duty required in
all branches of the service. It was frequently the
case that the aviator would command a ship with
a gun on it and do double duty, acting as scout, or
he would chase and fight an enemy, manipulating
the gun while manoeuvering the machine. It was
the sort of duty in which Lieutenant Guyon was
engaged at the time he was promoted to the command,
and supplied with the new type of machine.</p>

<p>Naturally, as commander of the squadron, he
was at liberty to take any one he desired in his
flights, and as he had a real affection for the boys,
he took delight in having them accompany him on
many of his exploits. It was the custom for the
lieutenant to entrust the piloting of the machine
to one of the boys, while he acted as a scout. Frequently
Ralph would perform this duty, while Alfred,
with his camera engaged, under the direction
of the lieutenant, taking such photos as were
deemed necessary to supplement the Department
maps.</p>

<p>Thus over a month was spent in scouting duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and, as the weather became somewhat chilly, especially
in the evenings, they never went aloft without
being well muffled up. One morning the lieutenant
called out to the boys that they were likely
to have a busy day before them, as the weather
was unusually mild for the season.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the hangar the machine
was already out of the shed, and the lieutenant was
busy with the charts in consultation with the officer
of the day. Evidently something unusual
was afoot, for they waited more than an hour
before the lieutenant re-appeared.</p>

<p>"You might wrap up well," he said. "I have
ordered a good luncheon, as we shall have a good
long scouting area to cover."</p>

<p>"Which way are we going?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Directly across the city, and then to the east.
There is some unusually active business going on
between this and Metz."</p>

<p>"Think I had better load up the camera pretty
well, even though it is a little misty," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"By all means," responded the lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock before all was ready, when
the lieutenant, addressing Ralph, said: "After we
pass over Verdun, going east, we cross what is
called the La Pietrie forests. The principal towns
we shall visit are Conflans and Briey, both within
the German lines. Through those towns are the
principal railway lines which supply the enemy
forces to the west with provisions and ammunition.
We have eight bombs aboard to be used at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
convenient points. After lightening up the machine
by disposing of them we may make a visit to
Longwy, a town twenty-two miles north of Verdun.
We ought to have good maps of the railroad
sections over there."</p>

<p>As they arose the weather was somewhat hazy,
so it was difficult to make observations at high altitudes.
They, therefore, ascended at available
points, and took a number of snapshots. To the
left the Meuse river, and the edge of the forest
beyond were distinctly visible, although they were
then registering an altitude of more than 5,000
feet, and were five miles east of the river. To the
east was an impenetrable haze, so the lieutenant
directed the machine toward the river, and soon
the German encampment and lines were visible
through Barencourt.</p>

<p>All were on the alert to notice signs of the enemy's
machines, for they were now in such a position
that the Germans would be most likely to
observe them, but there was not an indication that
they would be molested. They then turned the
machine to the northeast where a bridge was visible
in the distance, and the lieutenant shouted
through the tube:</p>

<p>"Make for the first bridge; follow the track on
this side for a quarter of a mile, so as to give me
a chance to aim. Then take the second bridge to
the north further on, and in doing so pass the factory
beyond."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The track was reached, and directions followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Long before they were over the bridge the lieutenant
pushed down the lever which released a
bomb, which could plainly be seen at first, but they
soon lost sight of the flying missile. A moment
later the second bomb was released. How long it
seemed for even the first bomb to reach the earth!
As they were directly over the bridge an explosion
was plainly visible. The first bomb had missed the
bridge, but before they had time to comment on it
the second one burst at the end of the bridge, and
one of the spans went down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus125.jpg" width="500" height="320" alt="A Dangerous Position" title="" />
</div>

<p>The factory was now in view. "Go down
lower," shouted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Alfred nudged the lieutenant, and pointed to the
north. "That looks like an airship," he said.</p>

<p>"So it is," replied the lieutenant, after a hasty
glance. "But we must attend to this little business
first," he continued, as his foot was extended
down to the bomb dropper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have hit it!" shouted Alfred in glee.
"Now for the other bridge."</p>

<p>They were not as successful with the last structure,
although three bombs were expended on it.</p>

<p>"Now, where is the flyer you saw?" asked the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"It went easy just before we reached the second
bridge," said Alfred. "I don't see it now."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we shall have to go to Longwy
to find where it is," said the lieutenant. "Can
you see the city beyond?" he continued, pointing
to the north. "Go to the left of the city," he said
through the tube.</p>

<p>"Why did you tell him to go to the left?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"In that way we can avoid the long range aircraft
guns, which we know are mounted in the
forts to the east of the town," was the reply.</p>

<p>They were soon on the northern side of the
town, and in looking south they were surprised
to see two machines, one making for the east and
the other seeming to fly directly toward them.</p>

<p>"That fellow will be a little surprised when he
finds what he has to deal with," said the lieutenant
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"It's a Fokker, isn't it?" shouted Ralph
through the tube.</p>

<p>"Quite right; when I give the signal turn
to the left, and describe a sharp circle. I'll fool
him," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The signal came; the machine veered around
just as the Fokker came plainly into sight. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the turn was made the lieutenant turned the machine
gun to the other side, and when the sight
was cleared past the wings he gave the first turn
of the crank to the gun.</p>

<p>There was a hum and a succession of cracks,
which seemed to surprise the man in the Fokker.
He evidently thought that the French machine was
trying to get away, or it never would have ventured
so close.</p>

<p>"The other machine is coming!" cried Alfred.</p>

<p>"Here is where we can get in the fun," said the
lieutenant. "Make a straight line for the one
coming up in the east. Go on until I signal."</p>

<p>This was a most audacious move, and while
Ralph was guiding the machine toward the
stranger the lieutenant poured a constant stream
of shot into the first comer. It must not be
assumed, however, that the German machines
were idle during this period. Both were firing,
but the shots went wild, especially after the daring
move just made.</p>

<p>"Up! up! as high as you can go!" was the next
order.</p>

<p>The machine tilted, and the lieutenant looked
back at Ralph approvingly. "She is a dandy
climber," said the lieutenant musingly. "Now
I'd like to see them follow a bit."</p>

<p>One of the machines actually tried to imitate
them, but the other ship was noticed wavering
and swaying from side to side.</p>

<p>"Something is the matter with that fellow,"
said Alfred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; he's done for, and we can easily polish
off the other one," remarked the lieutenant, as
he watched the falling machine. "Now turn
around quickly and dive for the one who is trailing
us," said the lieutenant through the tube.</p>

<p>Ralph banked the machine, and brought it
around as quickly as possible. The machine was
not a quick-turning one, but the oncoming machine
was not prepared for the manoeuver, for
it seemed to hesitate which way to go. If it went
to the left it would be impossible to use its gun,
and if it turned to the right it would be at the
mercy of the Frenchman's gun. The only remedy
was to dive; down went the machine at a sharp
angle. The lieutenant's shots went wild, but
they were soon rid of their troublesome companion.</p>

<p>"I suppose we'll have the whole German flying
corps after us now," said the lieutenant. "Turn
for home."</p>

<p>No sooner had they turned than another machine
came up, this time a most determined
fellow.</p>

<p>"Up! up!" again came the command, "and keep
pointing that way. You might also veer to the
left."</p>

<p>This time it was one of the well-known Taubes,
with the disadvantage, however, that she was a
tractor,&mdash;that is, had the propeller in front, like
the Bleriot monoplane, so that it prevented the
driver from shooting head on, whereas the Farman
biplane was a pusher,&mdash;that is, had the gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
mounted in front, and the propeller behind the
planes. During the evolution of circling, however,
the biplane had to present a broadside, which
gave the Taube a chance to pour in a stream of
shot, many of which took effect.</p>

<p>"That was a close shot!" shouted Ralph
through the tube. The lieutenant looked back,
and pointed to the tube. A shot had gone through
it, causing Alfred and Ralph to look at each other
in undisguised dismay.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus129.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="A Safety Manoeuver" title="" />
</div>

<p>At every turn the lieutenant ground out the
shot, and soon the barometer registered a height
of 6,400 feet. Two miles more and the Taube
made a peculiar turn, and glided to the right.</p>

<p>"You have hit him," said Alfred in excitement,
and the lieutenant stopped churning.</p>

<p>"It seems like it," was the reply. "When we
come back on the circle, go lower," he said to
Ralph, "and I can finish him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>As they crept up closer and closer, the lieutenant,
with his hand on the crank, waited for the
final chance. Like a dying gladiator the Taube
turned, and a most terrific storm of shot came
from the quick firer. This was the only time that
the boys actually heard the thuds of the striking
missiles on the body of the machine. It proved
to be the last effort of the Taube; it dropped away,
but still held its upright position.</p>

<p>Instantly the engine of the biplane stopped.
The lieutenant, with his hand still on the crank,
turned and shouted:</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>There was dead silence, and sudden darkness,
for they could not see in either direction. They
had entered a dense cloud.</p>

<p>"Have we started on the down glide?" continued
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I am trying to hold it up," said Ralph. As he
spoke they emerged from the cloud, but the Taube
was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>"Try the starter," said the lieutenant feverishly.</p>

<p>"Can't do it," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then hold it steady while I examine the tank,"
said the lieutenant. He leaned over, and almost
immediately exclaimed: "The connection is shot
away."</p>

<p>"I will make a long glide if you can fix it in the
meantime," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; I will connect the other tank," was the
reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>It required less than a minute to perform this
operation, but despite the repair the engine would
not turn.</p>

<p>After another examination the lieutenant
looked up from the pit, and said: "It's all up now.
The other tank is also empty."</p>

<p>The barometer now showed that they were only
a little over three thousand feet above the earth.
A landing must be made, that was evident; but
where? Alfred pointed to a forest, directly east.</p>

<p>"That might be a good place to come down, because
there doesn't seem to be any houses there."</p>

<p>"Just the place if we can find a spot
big enough," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>With his field glasses he scanned the forest.</p>

<p>"Do you see that strip of dark green a little
to the left? That is a clear space, I am sure.
Steer for that after circling around. We are still
high enough to enable us to make a careful observation
of the spot."</p>

<p>The machine descended in its regular glide, and
they passed over the indicated spot.</p>

<p>"That is a dandy place if you can hit it right,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>It was narrow, not more than a hundred feet
wide, but it extended diagonally up the hill, not
the most desirable place to land, by any means,
but it was the only thing to be done.</p>

<p>"Where shall I land?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Try to strike the second clump of brush; do
you see what I mean?" asked the lieutenant, his
words tumbling over each other in his haste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can do it," was the reply.</p>

<p>"May you have good luck," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>They approached the end of the open space between
the trees. Fortunately the wind was not
blowing, and the fuselage struck the first clump
of brush, but they passed over it without difficulty.
Ralph then threw up the elevator sharply, and the
front end tilted, while the body of the machine
sank down gently, and the landing was made without
a jar.</p>

<p>"That was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
You deserve great credit for that piece of work,"
said the lieutenant, as he leaned back and patted
Ralph.</p>

<p>They leaped from the machine, and for a moment
stood there helpless with the reaction which
set in, the boys, particularly, being influenced by
the great strain. The lieutenant was the first to
speak: "Well, here we are in a pretty fix; but it
might be worse," he said.</p>

<p>"No; we haven't a drop of petrol left," said
Ralph ruefully. "Both tanks were perforated."</p>

<p>They sat down to consider the situation. It was
now past five o'clock, and although it was generally
the custom to take luncheon with them on
these trips, the extra amount which had been
stored was barely sufficient for a half meal. The
sun was going down, and they had no idea of their
location except that, by calculating, the lieutenant
judged they might be fifteen miles northeast of
Longwy. Everything was still, except the evening
chirrup of the birds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is too late to do any investigating tonight;
but our first duty in the morning must be to arrange
for food," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they had taken the precaution to
carry plenty of wraps, so they were not at all
uncomfortable. They gathered leaves, made up
comfortable berths, and, after a most exciting day,
slept soundly all night.</p>

<p>As soon as the first grey of the morning sun
lightened up they arose, and began an investigation
of the surrounding vicinity. A reconnoitering
journey was proposed, as, during the night,
faint whistles of locomotives could be heard coming
from the east.</p>

<p>"That is the direction we must go," said the
lieutenant, as they prepared themselves for the
trip.</p>

<p>They entered a dense forest, setting their course
by the compass, and marched due east for an hour
without seeing the first sign of habitation, when
they were suddenly startled by a locomotive whistle,
which could not be more than a mile away.
They drew back and listened for a time, then cautiously
crept forward, looking for an opening.
A quarter of a mile to the left they discovered a
wagon trail leading to the north.</p>

<p>This began to look as though some one might be
living in the vicinity. The trail was followed, as
cautiously and as closely as possible, and a mile
beyond a cabin was sighted. This was the time
for them to exercise care, but they felt sure the
people living there would sympathize with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, we are in Belgium now, and they hate
the Germans," said the lieutenant. "I suppose
we are close to the border of Luxemburg, and the
people there feel the same as the Belgians."</p>

<p>"Do you know a place in Belgium called Bovigny?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the lieutenant. "That is on
the other side of Luxemburg, close to the frontier.
Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"That is where we entered Belgium, and near
where we assisted in capturing the auto load of
Germans," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bovigny is less than forty miles from
this place," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Isn't that strange," said Ralph. "Here we
are, close to the place where we started on this
excursion. Why, we made a regular circle to get
here," and they laughed at the situation.</p>

<p>It was now past six o'clock in the morning. No
one was in sight, and they assumed it might be too
early for the people, so they waited for an hour;
still there was no sign that the cabin was occupied.</p>

<p>"I suppose we might as well go closer and investigate."
They went forward without seeing a
sign of life, except a dozen or more chickens,
which were scattered over the lawn to the rear of
the cabin. "If there is any one there a whistle
might bring them out," continued the lieutenant.</p>

<p>There was no response, and after waiting a
short time they circled about the house, and they
saw that the front door was open, but there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
no furniture within. They then boldly approached,
and began to examine the contents of
the rooms. Not a scrap of food was found, although
ants and other vermin were numerous,
and there was a mouldy smell in the second room,
there being only two compartments or rooms.
While they were searching about, two chickens appeared
at the door, and with a common instinct
the boys encouraged a closer acquaintance, to the
amusement of the lieutenant. One of the chickens
was finally trapped, and a meal was soon prepared
and cooked in the oven. They had barely time to
finish the repast, when a shot was heard in the
woods to the south, at which they hurriedly left
the cottage, and rushed to the nearest clump of
brush across the clearing. A second shot followed,
evidently quite near, but apparently from
the same direction as the first.</p>

<p>"They are probably hunters," remarked the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Isn't our machine over in that direction?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they would do if they found
it?" queried Alfred.</p>

<p>"I think it would be perfectly safe if the hunters
are natives. I am sure they would suspect
the truth, for they would at once recognize it as a
French machine," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Would it be safe to go in that direction?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That was in my mind," replied the lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"As we must find some one in this region, and
they seem to me to be the most likely fellows to
approach, come on," he added.</p>

<p>They hurriedly went forward, expecting every
minute to catch sight of the hunters. Their progress
was slow, as the ground was full of leaves,
and the wood thick; besides, there was considerable
underbrush. They thus wearily tramped on
and on for more than an hour, covering a distance
which should have brought them close to the location
of their machine. Despite all their efforts
it could not be found nor the place located.</p>

<p>The only remedy was to retrace their steps and
go back to the cabin, and from that place they
could readily follow the wagon road back to the
place where they emerged from the woods. The
cottage was reached shortly after noon, and an
hour was spent in catching several of the chickens
and roasting them, so that it was in the middle
of the afternoon before they again retraced
their steps back to the starting point.</p>

<p>Here another difficulty presented itself. They
could not find the place where they first reached
the trail, so they sat down to wait for the welcome
sound of a train to guide them. Even that aid
was denied them, and as darkness was now coming
on a suitable place was found to rest for the
night at the base of an uprooted tree. There the
night was spent in comparative comfort, as, fortunately,
the weather still continued mild and agreeable.</p>

<p>The matter of food now became a vital one, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
so, also, was the necessity of locating the airplane.
The matter was debated, and the lieutenant finally
said: "We must find our machine; from that point
I think we should strike to the west. It would be
unwise for us to approach the railroad to the
east, as that is in the hands of the Germans, and
every mile of it is patrolled."</p>

<p>By means of the compass they trudged to the
west, and soon reached familiar ground. As they
were about to enter the open space, which was
recognized as their landing place, voices were
heard. The three glanced at each other in dismay,
until Alfred's keen ears detected a French word
or two, of which he quickly advised his companions.</p>

<p>"I will call to them in French," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>He did so, and the two men, for the lieutenant
could now distinctly see them, were startled, but
in another moment returned an answer.</p>

<p>"We are French," said the lieutenant. "That
is our machine, and we have been reconnoitering."</p>

<p>"We are friends," said one of the men.</p>

<p>In another moment the lieutenant and the boys
were at the machine, and grasped the hands of the
hunters. "We are Belgians," continued the
man.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"In the forest, north of Messanoy," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Are there any Germans near?" asked the lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, at St. Leger, to the north, and at the
junction of Arlon, to the northeast. But troops
are constantly going along both roads to Longwy
and Metz," replied one of the spokesmen.</p>

<p>"Where can we get something to eat?" was
asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, we can arrange that," said one of the men
with a smile. "Follow us."</p>

<p>On the way the lieutenant learned a great deal
of the system in force by the Germans. They were
conducted north, through the woods for fully a
mile where they reached a wagon trail. Here the
lieutenant stopped.</p>

<p>"Where does this trail lead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From the railway station on the east line to
a little village on the west side of the forest," was
the answer.</p>

<p>"Then we were on this trail yesterday," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>If they had gone a quarter of a mile farther,
after reaching the cottage, they could have seen
the first cottage in the village. It was also learned
that the two men were the hunters whose shots
were heard the previous day while at the cabin.
The men lived a quarter of a mile from the village,
in the elevated part, near the border of the forest,
and like true Belgians were glad to help their
French brothers.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h2>EXCITING EXPLOITS ON LAND</h2>

<p><br />"That is the place where I live," said the elder
of the two men, as he pointed to a low cottage on
the side of a hill, "and Raoul here lives below the
turn. We must approach the house cautiously, for
we know spies to be in this part of the country."</p>

<p>"I will go ahead," said Raoul. "Follow and
go up to your house through the orchard."</p>

<p>They tarried by the roadside until the signal
appeared. Upon reaching the house they were
greeted by Felix's wife, for that was the name
Raoul bestowed on his friend. A good meal was
soon spread before them, and in the meantime the
lieutenant was plied with questions, as the people
in that section had no opportunities for learning
what was really taking place in the outside world.</p>

<p>Finally the lieutenant asked: "Do you know of
any place where we could get some petrol?"</p>

<p>The men mused for a while, and shook their
heads. "You know," Felix said, "everything
around here is controlled by the Germans, and
petrol is one of the things that is kept strictly
under guard."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know the place where they store it?"
inquired the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it would be dangerous to attempt to
get any of it," said Raoul.</p>

<p>"I have a plan," said Felix, "but we cannot do
anything before night. I know every step of the
way to the station, and will take you there this
evening."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the lieutenant. "In the meantime,
give me a diagram of the station, and the
roads leading to it. That will help me to become
familiar with the surroundings."</p>

<p>For the next hour the lieutenant was busily
engaged in learning all about the country, and
where the stores and ammunition were kept.</p>

<p>"I think we might as well have some of that
petrol," said the lieutenant with a smile, as he
looked at the boys, who nodded their approval, as
they were keen to participate in the plans which
the lieutenant had formed.</p>

<p>That night, after ten o'clock, they appeared at
their place of concealment, for it was thought wise
to keep away from the house in the event any of
the prying neighbors should happen in. Together
they cautiously found their way to the railway
and walked along the track until the first switch
was reached. While waiting there so that Felix
could point out the different objects, Ralph drew
the lever, and set it so the first train would take
the switch.</p>

<p>The lieutenant saw it and nodded approvingly.
Ahead a few hundred feet was a low building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
which was reached by the track which led from
the switch.</p>

<p>"The guards are stationed at that shed across
the track, and sometimes they come over," said
Felix.</p>

<p>"But is the building open?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"There are no doors; only open arches. The
tanks can be loaded and unloaded from the
tracks," was the answer.</p>

<p>They were carrying three vessels, such as are
usually employed for transporting petrol in small
quantities, and nearing the shed the lieutenant
said: "Remain here and await my orders. I will
go ahead and investigate."</p>

<p>With two of the receptacles in his hands he
crouched as low as possible, and made his way
along the track, but before reaching the structure
he left the track, and approached the shed from
the south side. He was gone for more than fifteen
minutes, and when he returned with the receptacles
filled he immediately seized the other,
returning with it also filled in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Now, take these to the cross road, and out of
sight. I will be there in fifteen minutes," and
saying this he quietly left them.</p>

<p>The boys and Felix carried the cans to the
designated place with the greatest care, for the
fluid was precious to them. No sooner had they
hidden the receptacles when something like a flash
of lightning illuminated everything about them,
and this was followed by an explosion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Felix gasped as he gazed in the direction of the
sheds, for he divined the cause. The boys, too,
were startled.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the lieutenant did that?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied Felix.</p>

<p>"Do you really think he did it? I wonder if
he is hurt?" said Alfred, his voice in a tremor.</p>

<p>They waited for more than a half hour. What
if the lieutenant had been caught in the catastrophe?
They could see the soldiers at the station
rushing hither and thither, and the people were
going toward the station from all directions.</p>

<p>"Mighty good thing we hid in this place," said
Felix.</p>

<p>Felix and the boys were now in consternation,
and as they had about decided to go up to their
former place of concealment, the headlight of a
train approached from the south. It slowed down
a little as it neared the station.</p>

<p>"The switch!" was Ralph's exclamation. As
he said that the train reached the switch, and
turned to the track leading to the fiercely burning
shed. Half of the train ran through a sea of fire
before it could be checked. It was a terrifying
sight, and Ralph shook with fear at the sight.
Fortunately, it was a freight train, or the toll of
death would have been awful.</p>

<p>"This begins to look bad for us. I am afraid
the lieutenant has been captured. This place is
getting to be too dangerous, and we must leave at
once," said Felix, as he seized one of the cans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go down and see what the trouble is,"
said Alfred, but Felix shook his head. Nevertheless,
although Ralph also remonstrated, and insisted
on accompanying him, Alfred had his way.
One would be safer than two, he thought, and without
further words he crawled along the fence,
avoiding contact with those who were in the near
vicinity.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Alfred left, the lieutenant
returned, and was shocked to learn of Alfred's
journey.</p>

<p>"Take these cans up to the house, and I will go
back and try to find him," he told them.</p>

<p>Alfred, meanwhile, had reached the track near
the switch, and not far from the rear end of the
burning train. As he was about to cross the track
his foot struck an object, and he fell across the
track. He was surprised to see several men appear
and gaze at him, and it must be admitted that
he was decidedly nervous over the situation.
However, he did not venture to say anything, but
quickly started at the fire, for he now stood with
others, in the full glare of the flames. As no one
paid any attention to him, it occurred to him that
he had as much right there as the villagers.</p>

<p>All about him he heard criticisms of the calamity,
and some one suggested that the fire and explosion
was caused by a French airship, and, in
fact, this seemed to be the general opinion.</p>

<p>Alfred wandered about listlessly, now feeling
assured that the people knew nothing of the lieutenant,
for he was certain that the news of the capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of a Frenchman would cause great excitement.
Waiting the first opportunity, he slipped
over the fence, and crawled along in the shadow of
some brush for several hundred feet, when, to his
consternation, a tall man arose in his path.</p>

<p>He turned, and was about to leap the fence,
when he heard a familiar voice: "Alfred."</p>

<p>He immediately recognized the lieutenant, and
it is questionable which of the two felt happier
at the meeting. They quickly ascended the hill,
where they met a gloomy pair in Ralph and Felix,
and the lieutenant told his story. He had allowed
the petrol to run from one of the tanks after he
took away the last receptacle, and when he returned
he tapped three of the other tanks, expecting
to wait five or ten minutes before firing it.</p>

<p>While thus waiting two of the guards approached,
and he hid behind a box car on the opposite
siding. He feared that his plans had miscarried,
for he felt sure the guards would discover
the petrol. They did not, however, go into the
sheds, but remained outside, engaged in conversation
for more than ten minutes. When they left
he lost no time in again crossing the track.</p>

<p>He reasoned that the whole of the interior of
the first set of sheds must have been flooded by
that time, and the problem now was to ignite it,
and get away safely, so he struck a match and
lighted a small saturated cloth, which was thrown
into the nearest opening. It caught instantly, and
as the entire shed was now filled with the vapor,
the explosion followed before he could get across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the track. It was so great in violence that he was
hoisted from his feet, so it seemed to him, and
completely stunned. How long he remained in
that condition of half stupor he did not know, but
he soon heard a babel of voices, and saw everything
about him as bright as day. Then, to his
surprise, a train came up the switch, and rushed
through the fire. It was this which probably saved
him from being detected.</p>

<p>"You may be sure," he said, "that as soon as
my senses returned I knew what had happened,
and that train started my sluggish brain into activity.
I ran away from the train, and so did several
others. No one cared to follow me, thinking,
of course, that I belonged to the crew. That explains
my long absence."</p>

<p>"Now, how are we to get the petrol over to the
machine?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"We must ask Felix about it," said the lieutenant.
"Probably you can help us out in that direction?"</p>

<p>"I have a light wagon," said Felix, "but we
must not venture out with it until after midnight;
in the meantime I will go down to the village and
get all the news."</p>

<p>He returned in an hour. "It is reported that
an airship did the damage," said Felix.</p>

<p>Shortly after two o'clock in the morning the
light wagon was on hand, and Raoul accompanied
them. After loading the wagon with the cans they
started on the trip through the forest. Felix and
Raoul both remained with the lieutenant and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
boys until the tanks were repaired, and the sun
had appeared. The machine was then turned
around, and headed for the opening in the forest
through which they had entered. Felix and Raoul,
in the meantime, diligently cut away the underbrush
and bushes in the path of the machine so it
would be able to make a fair start.</p>

<p>The boys now mounted the machine after shaking
hands with the two men, and the lieutenant,
reaching into his pocket, drew out a hundred franc
note, which he tendered to them. They refused
to take it. The lieutenant then threw it on the
ground, saying: "This belongs to Belgium, and
you had better take it."</p>

<p>"Good bye, and God bless you," shouted Felix,
as the motor began to hum. The machine gliding
down the incline quickly gathered speed, and it
was soon in the air.</p>

<p>After reaching an altitude of a thousand meters,
the lieutenant said: "It would be interesting to
pay the village a visit after our pleasant experience
there."</p>

<p>Ralph, accordingly, turned the rudder, and the
machine swung to the right. It required only a
few minutes to reach the scene, and there, notwithstanding
the distance, they could see the blackened
and still smoking ruins in the two immense
spaces adjoining the station.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, they appreciated the fact
that a worthy task had been accomplished, for this
station was one of the most important oil supply
points along that whole line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldiers were rushing wildly about the station
grounds, and the officials there were no doubt
now assured, after seeing the machine, that the
depot had actually been destroyed by a bomb from
that airplane.</p>

<p>The machine was now directed toward Longwy,
and after giving that city a wide berth, flew directly
south, with Verdun as the objective. The
grounds below and to the west of that city were
reached before ten o'clock, to the astonishment of
the men quartered there, for it had been reported
the night before that the lieutenant and the boys
had been captured or killed in the fight at Longwy.</p>

<p>The lieutenant won the cross for the exploit, and
the boys received honorable mention from the government.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h2>A DARING BOMB RAID TO THE RHINE</h2>

<p><br />The exploits of the lieutenant and the boys soon
became the talk of the camp. From enemy sources
more was learned later about the results of the
destruction of the oil station, which fully confirmed
the earlier reports of the great damage
which had been done. Although up to this time
there had been some objection raised against the
flights of the boys it must be said that after that
event there was no one to criticise them.</p>

<p>During the winter months not much was done
excepting scout work, as the weather was too severe
for the men in the trenches to attempt any
advances, but as the spring months came on everything
became more active, thus imposing greater
duty on the air fleet.</p>

<p>Not much of personal interest to the boys took
place until May, when the great raid was planned
to attack the munition factories and chemical
works at and near Ludwigshafen, on the Rhine.</p>

<p>"Ralph, did you hear that there is going to be
a big expedition this week right into Germany?"
said Alfred, who had been with the lieutenant at
headquarters early one morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, although the boys are always talking about
something of that kind," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"But this is a sure go; the lieutenant told me
so a few minutes ago," responded Alfred.</p>

<p>"Is the lieutenant going, do you know?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that is why he told me about
it," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they will let us go with
him?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't ask him, but I looked at him
pretty hard, and I guess he knows how we feel
about it," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>The rumor turned out to be true, for the following
day orders were formally received to prepare
eighteen machines for a raid to the Rhine. The
lieutenant announced the news to the boys, and
added: "I suppose, of course, you wouldn't like
to go on such a venturesome mission?"</p>

<p>"Go!" exclaimed both boys in unison.</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed. "Well, if you insist on
it I shall have to take you with me. The Seraph
(which was the name of their airplane, although
it was officially known as No. 47) will be fixed to
carry a dozen bombs for the occasion."</p>

<p>"But how about the quick firer?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"We must dispense with that on this trip.
Bombs are more valuable," answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Well, aren't we going to take any guard ships
along?" inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; six of the machines will be armed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
we must use every ounce we can carry on the
Seraph. Before starting we must go over the
route, as similar instructions will have to be issued
to all of the flyers," remarked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are to go?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"The objective point is Mannheim on the Rhine.
The river is eighty miles due east, and Mannheim
is about fifty miles farther down the river. That
city is on the eastern bank of the river, and Ludwigshafen
is a small town, on the opposite shore
where the great laboratory of Badische Analin
and Soda Fabrik is located," remarked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"So we are going to destroy a soda factory?"
said Ralph with a grin.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied the lieutenant, amused
at the intimation. "The principal thing turned
out at the plant before the war was nitrate, a
chemical most essential in the manufacture of explosives,
and the importance of the place may be
understood when I tell you that fully two-thirds of
this product used by the Germans comes from that
place."</p>

<p>"When will the start be made?" asked Ralph
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then I want to see the map," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"By all means," answered the lieutenant.
"Now, you will notice that here is a canal shown
on the map which runs due east. That is the
Rhine-Marne, which parallels this river, the Zorn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
The Zorn flows into the Rhine at Strassburg. You
know, of course, that rivers, or canals, are the
best guides for our purposes, so we must get these
firmly fixed in our minds."</p>

<p>"Yes, that and the towns are sure to carry
us along without mistake," remarked Alfred.
"What is that place, Saarburg? It is on the
river."</p>

<p>"That is an ancient town, and you can hardly
fail to recognize the place, for it is surrounded by
a great stone wall. It also contains a strong garrison.
Now note the next important place, twenty
miles farther on; that is Zabern. From that place
we can see the Rhine at various places, as we intend
to fly at an altitude of two thousand meters,
or, as you would say, 6500 feet."</p>

<p>"Why is it necessary to go to such a high altitude?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Because at Saarburg, Zabern and Brumath
they have long range anti-airship guns, and we
cannot take any chances," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The camp was a seething place of excitement the
following morning. Twelve of the machines carried
bombs exclusively; some of the airplanes had
six bombs, each weighing 180 pounds; one had
three bombs of 300 pounds each, and the Seraph
carried ten 120-lb. high-explosive cylinders.</p>

<p>These were placed in a suitable case having
compartments, the lower ends of the compartments
being provided with outwardly opening
doors, capable of being released by the pressure
of the foot operating against a lever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to rig up the cameras so we can
take pictures of the explosions," said Alfred, as
they made their way to the hangar.</p>

<p>"That is a splendid idea," remarked the lieutenant.
"Such an enterprise would be commended
by the Intelligence Department of the
War Office. By all means make the arrangements,
for we expect to start in an hour."</p>

<p>Alfred rushed over to the supply depot, and
soon had the cameras in his possession, together
with extra rolls of films. Ralph accompanied the
lieutenant to the hangar to note the placing of the
bombs.</p>

<p>"Why are the bombs placed with the pointed
ends up?" asked Ralph, as the men were placing
them in position.</p>

<p>"So the fulminate cap can be placed on, preparatory
to launching," remarked the foreman.</p>

<p>"Why, won't they go off without the cap on?
Wouldn't a concussion explode them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it would require a pretty tough jar to
make them go off," replied the man.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the eighteen machines
arose, and started for the east. The sun was full
in their faces, but the misty weather made it look
like a great red ball, symbolic of the day's work.
It was hard to get away from the glare of the sun
as they arose to the height which the orders compelled
them to take, and at Saarburg some of the
machines were actually hit by missiles from the
anti-airship guns.</p>

<p>The first city of importance to greet their eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
after leaving Brumath, was Lauterbach, and then
Karlsruhe, a city of over 100,000 was sighted.</p>

<p>"We are now thirty-five miles from Ludwigshafen,"
shouted the lieutenant, through the tube.
"Keep well to the west of the river, and maintain
the same height, until the city is reached."</p>

<p>Two miles before Mannheim was reached eight
of the machines swerved to the right, and crossed
the river, their destination being the town of Oppau,
several miles beyond the town, where large
manufacturing establishments were turning out
ammunition.</p>

<p>"We are bound for the chemical factories," said
the lieutenant. "See the workmen running about.
They have, no doubt, heard of our mission by this
time."</p>

<p>"Which way shall I point the camera?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Straight down," replied the lieutenant. "I
am going to signal No. 62 to take the lead, so we
will be the fifth in line. That will give you a splendid
opportunity to notice the effect of the explosions
and to snap them."</p>

<p>The lieutenant set the signal, "echelon formation,"
which means step formation, one machine
being ahead and a little to the right or to the left
of the succeeding one. In that manner the ten
machines flew along, the distance between them
being about eight hundred feet, and by this arrangement
each succeeding machine was able to
observe the effect of the bomb dropped by the
machine ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Mannheim was avoided, and the machines
steered straight for the chemical headquarters on
the left side of the stream where No. 62 released
the first bomb. Alfred strained his eyes, and saw
a flash below. It missed a building, and he shouted
the information to Ralph through the tube.</p>

<p>"If that had gone a hundred feet to the right it
would have taken a dandy building,&mdash;there, the
second shot did it; that came from old Spic's machine;
whew-w-w, but look at it! That smoke is
as black as coal,&mdash;must be lots of chemicals there.
Another,&mdash;and the second building smashed to
flinders. The lieutenant is going to drop the first
one,&mdash;down she goes! I took two fine ones just
now. I'll bet the last picture will show it up just
as it happened. Two more snaps. We are going
to turn and go back. 62 is making the circle."
Thus Alfred graphically described the first trip
over the doomed town.</p>

<p>A dense cloud was now coming up, or, rather,
bunches of them in various places where the missiles
struck, and just as the Seraph was making
the turn a tremendous explosion was heard, which
actually seemed to jar the machine. Alfred arose
from his seat, and the lieutenant's tense face
showed that something unusual had happened, as
he gazed below. All the buildings were emptied
and scores of operatives were lining up along the
river bank, and moving toward the great bridge
south of the works.</p>

<p>"Did you notice that big explosion?" asked Alfred
through the tube.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Ralph nodded his head affirmatively.</p>

<p>"That hit the largest building in the place, and
there isn't much left of it. Did you see that tall
chimney at the left side of the town? Well, that
looks just like a big cannon with the smoke and fire
coming out of it," commented Alfred.</p>

<p>The ten ships crossed the town twice, discharging
all their bombs, but they waited in the air for
twenty-five minutes until the first of the detached
airplanes from the north appeared. During this
time there was plenty of opportunity to see the extent
of the damage which had been done to the
great factories.</p>

<p>At a signal the airplanes, constituting the
squadron, were lined up in two columns, and before
they had proceeded far the signals told the
success of that part of the squadron which had
gone to Oppau. The signal was now set for
"Home," and the machines, by this time lightened
of their missiles, made a tremendous speed, until
after they left the Rhine, and were making the last
lap of the journey, when the machine carrying
Captain De Goye and his Adjutant Buanau-Varilla,
was forced to descend, owing to an accident.</p>

<p>The different machines circled around, hoping
to be able to render assistance, but shortly after
the airplane landed it was discovered to be in
flames, and it was conjectured that seeing relief
was out of the question the aviators had destroyed
the machine to prevent its being of any use to the
enemy.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h2>A TERRIBLE FIGHT IN THE CLOUDS</h2>

<p><br />The return to the base with only the single mishap
alluded to was cause for congratulations, and
the lieutenant came in for a large share of the
commendation.</p>

<p>In turn he prepared a special report setting
forth the work done by the boys on the eventful
journey. He pointed out that Ralph piloted the
machine the entire distance, giving him, as the
commanding officer of one division, time to direct
the operation of the machines and attend to the
bombs, while he had the pleasure of presenting to
the authorities a set of unique photographs taken
by Alfred at the very time the bombs were thrown
and exploded.</p>

<p>When the roll was called, two days thereafter,
the men of the squadrons were lined up, an officer
from headquarters passed down the line, and,
among other places, halted before the boys, who
stepped forward. On the breast of each was
pinned a medal, and as the officer did so he kissed
them on the cheeks, a custom which is faithfully
observed, in accordance with the regulations,
whenever a merit order is bestowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a cheer as the two blushing boys
stepped back to the line, and there were no
prouder hearts than theirs as they heard the encomiums
expressed on all sides for their bravery
and devotion to duty. It was a pleasure to many
other young Americans, who, like them, were volunteers
serving in the aviation corps, and many
of whom were afterwards also honored in like
manner.</p>

<p>There was hardly a day that there was not some
experience added to their store of knowledge pertaining
to airships, and the work connected with
flying, all of which was performed with efficiency
and credit.</p>

<p>But the work which they performed was not all
a series of jolly excursions without the corresponding
sorrows. The devotion of Lieutenant
Guyon to them dated from the time when that
brave officer was stricken while on a trial flight
from the camp at Bar-le-Duc. He never forgot
how they took charge of the machine, and brought
it safely to earth and cared for him so tenderly.
Thereafter, it was rarely the case that he went
aloft without one or both of the boys in his company.</p>

<p>Shortly after the foregoing events, while the
three were performing scout duty north of St.
Mihiel, they were attacked by two German machines,
an Albatross and a Taube, a combination
which, especially when operating against a single
machine, is capable of doing deadly work.</p>

<p>When the two enemy ships were sighted, Alfred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was in the pilot's seat, and under the direction
of the lieutenant, the airplane shot forward
directly in the path of the first machine, while
the lieutenant poured out a constant storm of shot.
The Albatross dived, and Alfred at once moved
the control to ascend, thus bringing their machine
above the Taube.</p>

<p>The object now was to so manoeuver their ship
as to keep between the two enemies, and in doing
so make it difficult for either of them to use the
quick firers without danger of hitting the other.
The Seraph was a rapid climber, due to the high
power of her engines.</p>

<p>"Send her up as rapidly as possible," shouted
the lieutenant. "Keep on going, and turn slowly
to the left, so as to make a big circle; that will
give me a chance to put in some shots."</p>

<p>Alfred knew the manoeuver, the purpose being
to bring the two machines into line with each
other, and thus enable the lieutenant to get his
gun in the range of both machines.</p>

<p>"A little down now, and more to the right;
there, steady," was the next command.</p>

<p>"Br-r-r-r-r" sounded the gun, as the officer
turned the crank.</p>

<p>"The Taube is going down," cried Ralph excitedly,
"and here comes another of the same
kind," continued Ralph.</p>

<p>"Go straight for the second one," shouted the
lieutenant, and Alfred knew that the same trick
had to be repeated.</p>

<p>But the new arrival did not accept the invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to fight on the lines that the first machine
adopted. Instead, it began to circle about at a
safe distance, endeavoring to secure the overhead
position.</p>

<p>"Follow that bird," said the lieutenant, "and
keep going. They will learn something about high
flying before they get through with us."</p>

<p>The Albatross was not making much headway
in the climbing game. On the other hand, the new
Taube was an extraordinary flyer.</p>

<p>"There is only one man aboard of her," said
the lieutenant. "Take the glasses, and see if you
can make out her number."</p>

<p>Ralph studied the machine for some time. "I
am not sure," he said, "but I think it is D 28. No
one but the pilot is aboard."</p>

<p>"That's good. He can't hit us head on. Trail
him or get ahead of him and keep on ascending,"
said the lieutenant, now preparing his rapid firer
with a new charge.</p>

<p>The Taube suddenly swerved to the right, and
let loose a full charge from his gun. It seemed
as though one side of the Seraph had the covering
of the planes ripped off, for the hail of bullets tore
right through the frame. Alfred shook his head
as he cleared away several bits of wreckage.</p>

<p>"How high are we?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Two thousand six hundred meters," was the
reply.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had his revenge, however, for
their own machine was now creeping up and gradually
getting a rear position. This was what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
had been aiming for. The stream of shots from
the Seraph's gun now began to tell. In one despairing
attempt the Taube turned fully half way
around and answered, but it was evident that
something was wrong with the ship.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Seraph darted down. Ralph and
the lieutenant looked back in surprise. Alfred's
head had dropped to one side, and one arm hung
over the side of the chassis.</p>

<p>The lieutenant leaned over and caught the elevating
rudder, not a moment too soon, and corrected
the machine. Ralph leaned over the side
of the body, and drew Alfred toward him, as the
lieutenant climbed into the aviator's seat. All
this took but a moment's time, but meanwhile it
was necessary for them to observe the enemy and
avoid him.</p>

<p>"The Taube is falling," cried out Ralph, "but
the Albatross is swinging around."</p>

<p>Before it was possible to correct the machine,
and avoid the danger, the gunner of the oncoming
aeroplane began to pump, and the shot began to
tell on the Seraph's framework. The lieutenant
now saw that it would be a terrific task to get
above the Albatross, so turning the control rudder
sharply, the Seraph made a quick slide below
its adversary.</p>

<p>Alfred did not move, and Ralph tried to control
himself, for in the great excitement attending the
above circumstances, he was almost distracted.
He was leaning partly over the body of the machine
when the lieutenant saw him crouch forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
He put his hand on the boy and tried to shake him,
but there was no response.</p>

<p>Down, down went the machine, still under absolute
control of the lieutenant, who turned the
machine in a circle in order to be sure to bring
it down within the French lines. When within
five hundred feet of the earth something seemed
to go wrong with the steering mechanism. The
lieutenant tugged and pulled the lever back and
forth. The machine refused to move forward in
a straight line, and landing while the machine is
describing a circular movement is a most dangerous
manoeuver.</p>

<p>Both boys were quiet, and the lieutenant feared
for the worst. A hundred feet more and all would
be over. In desperation he banked the machine
to stop its terrific speed. This helped the situation,
but did not prevent the spinning motion, and
finally the crash came.</p>

<p>They landed in a newly ploughed field, the worst
possible sort of place for a disabled machine.
The lieutenant and Ralph were thrown out of their
seats, but Alfred was held fast in the machine.</p>

<p>Many willing helpers were on hand, and they
found all three of the flyers were unconscious
when put into the van, but, fortunately, they were
within a half mile of the emergency hospital south
of St. Mihiel. On the way to the hospital a hurried
survey was made to ascertain the extent of the injuries,
but the physicians were silent.</p>

<p>Alfred regained consciousness before the hospital
was reached. The doctors said that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
was a severe bruise on the back of his head, as
though he had been struck by some heavy object.
The lieutenant opened his eyes, as he was placed
on the operating cot. He glanced around wildly
for a moment, and then asked: "Where are my
boys!"</p>

<p>"We have them here; they are all right," said
a nurse.</p>

<p>He forced a weak smile, turned his head to one
side, and was quiet.</p>

<p>Ralph had been shot through the body, too high
up, it was believed, to touch the lungs. A second
bullet had passed through the fleshy part of the
left arm, and he was very weak from loss of blood.
The three were placed on adjoining cots after
the first examination was over, and after all had
regained their normal senses a pair of stretcher
bearers entered the door, and bore a wounded man
to one of the adjoining cots.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was the first to observe the chevrons
on the sleeve of the patient, and that he was
a German. Ralph tried to raise up as he noticed
them carefully lift the wounded man, and deposit
him on the cot.</p>

<p>"That's the fellow who piloted the last Taube;
I'm sure of that. He's the fellow I saw through
the glasses," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Inquiry quickly established the truth of Ralph's
observation. His machine had fallen within
French lines, and not far from the place where
the Seraph struck. It was an odd coincidence.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was the most severely injured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
how badly no one knew at the time, for a certain
time must elapse before the full extent of the injury
in such cases develops. The next morning
the boys were informed that the lieutenant was
much worse, and then for two days they had no
news.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ralph's wounds were healing, and
no excessive fever developed. Alfred's spine
seemed to be affected by the terrific blow, but that
would be all right again in course of time.</p>

<p>The sad intelligence came to them a few days
thereafter that the lieutenant had died. It was, indeed,
a grief to them. They had grown to love
him as a friend, and they understood each other
so well. It was learned that his heart was too
weak to bear up against the internal injuries,
which he received when the machine struck the
earth.</p>

<p>It was two weeks before the boys were able to
leave the hospital, and they were then not able
to return to duty. The shock of their friend's
death was so acute that, as Ralph expressed it,
they never again wanted to see an airplane.</p>

<p>They were soon sent to Paris to recuperate, and
while there they formed plans which took them
into another part of the great war game, and we
may be able hereafter to follow them in their new
exploits.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
